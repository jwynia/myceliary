# Case Studies: Learning from History and Practice

These case studies document successful attempts to build technology outside capitalist structures. Each provides valuable lessons for current community technology initiatives.

## Why Study These Cases?

- **Proof of Possibility**: These examples demonstrate that alternative models can work
- **Practical Lessons**: Learn from both successes and challenges
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes and strategies
- **Inspiration**: See how communities have resisted and built alternatives

## Historical Examples

### [Project Cybersyn (Chile, 1971-1973)](project-cybersyn.html)
Revolutionary attempt to use technology for democratic socialist economic management. Despite being cut short by a coup, it demonstrated the feasibility of real-time economic coordination without markets.

**Key Lessons:**
- Distributed systems can enable democratic planning
- Worker participation in technology design is crucial
- Political vulnerability requires resilience strategies

### [Zapatista Communication Networks (1994-Present)](zapatista-networks.html)
Indigenous autonomous communities building their own communication infrastructure outside state and corporate control.

**Key Lessons:**
- Community ownership enables true autonomy
- Low-tech solutions can be more resilient
- Cultural context shapes technology choices

### [Black Panther Survival Programs (1966-1982)](black-panther-programs.html)
Community programs that demonstrated alternatives to capitalist social services, including early computer use for community organizing.

**Key Lessons:**
- Technology serves community needs, not profit
- Direct action creates immediate alternatives
- Coalition building amplifies impact

## Contemporary Initiatives

### [Platform Cooperatives Movement (2014-Present)](platform-cooperatives.html)
Worker and user-owned alternatives to corporate platforms across multiple sectors.

**Success Stories:**
- Stocksy United (photography)
- Up & Go (home services)
- Resonate (music streaming)
- Fairbnb (accommodation)

### [Time Banking Systems](time-banking.html)
Non-monetary exchange systems that value all labor equally and build community resilience.

**Active Networks:**
- TimeRepublic (global)
- hOurworld (USA)
- Tempo Time Credits (UK)

### [Mutual Aid Technology Networks](mutual-aid-tech.html)
Technology supporting community care and resource sharing outside market systems.

**Examples:**
- Mutual Aid Hub
- Community fridges networks
- Skill-sharing platforms

### [Community Mesh Networks](mesh-networks.html)
Locally-owned internet infrastructure serving communities ignored by corporate ISPs.

**Active Networks:**
- NYC Mesh
- Detroit Community Technology Project
- Guifi.net (Catalonia)

### [Worker-Owned Tech Cooperatives](worker-tech-coops.html)
Software development cooperatives building tools for social movements.

**Notable Coops:**
- CoLab Cooperative
- Agaric
- Zinc Collective
- Koumbit

## Patterns Across Cases

### Success Factors
1. **Community Ownership**: Direct control by users and workers
2. **Democratic Governance**: Participatory decision-making processes
3. **Mission Alignment**: Technology serves social goals
4. **Coalition Building**: Partnerships amplify impact
5. **Iterative Development**: Start small, learn, expand

### Common Challenges
1. **Resource Constraints**: Limited funding compared to corporate competitors
2. **Scale Tensions**: Balancing growth with democratic participation
3. **Technical Debt**: Maintaining systems with limited resources
4. **Political Opposition**: Resistance from established powers
5. **Sustainability Models**: Finding non-extractive revenue

### Strategic Lessons

#### Start Where You Are
- Use existing tools creatively
- Build on community assets
- Don't wait for perfect conditions

#### Design for Resilience
- Assume attacks will come
- Build redundancy
- Document everything
- Train many people

#### Center the Margins
- Design for most vulnerable users first
- Their safety is everyone's safety
- Their needs reveal system requirements

#### Practice Prefiguration
- Embody the future you want
- Process matters as much as outcome
- Build new systems while resisting old ones

## Using These Cases

### For Organizers
- Share stories to inspire participation
- Use patterns to guide strategy
- Learn from failures to avoid pitfalls
- Build on existing successes

### For Developers
- Study technical architectures
- Understand user needs in context
- See technology as one tool among many
- Design for community ownership

### For Funders
- Recognize value beyond profit
- Support long-term sustainability
- Fund coalition infrastructure
- Invest in documentation
