# Community Alternatives to Food Delivery Apps

Food delivery platforms extract massive fees from restaurants while underpaying drivers. Community alternatives can keep money local while providing better conditions for workers and restaurants.

## The Problem with Commercial Food Delivery

### Exploitative Apps and Their Practices

**DoorDash**
- Charges restaurants 15-30% commission
- Misclassifies drivers as contractors
- Uses dark patterns to hide true costs
- Manipulates search results based on commissions

**Uber Eats**
- Takes 15-30% from restaurants
- Algorithmic wage suppression for drivers
- Surge pricing that doesn't benefit drivers proportionally
- Locks restaurants into exclusivity deals

**Grubhub**
- Stacks multiple fees on restaurants
- Creates fake websites for restaurants
- Charges for phone calls even when no order placed
- Dominates through market consolidation

### Impact on Communities
- Restaurants operate on 3-5% margins; 30% fees are devastating
- Drivers earn below minimum wage after expenses
- Money flows out of communities to corporate headquarters
- Local food culture becomes homogenized

## Existing Community Alternatives

### CoopCycle (France)
**Model**: Federation of bike delivery cooperatives
- Worker-owners share in profits
- Open source platform available for reuse
- Federated structure allows local autonomy
- Covers 80+ cities across Europe

**Key Success Factors**:
- Started with passionate cyclists
- Built strong relationships with local restaurants
- Emphasized environmental benefits
- Created mutual support network between cities

### Eva (Montreal)
**Model**: Women-driven ride and delivery cooperative
- Prioritizes safety for women drivers and customers
- Shares model with food delivery
- Democratic governance structure
- Reinvests profits in community services

### Local Success Stories
- **Pizzeria Collective** (Madison, WI): Restaurants share delivery drivers
- **Bike Brigade** (Toronto): Volunteer delivery for community organizations
- **Durham Co-op Market**: Grocery delivery by member-workers

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Community Organizing (Months 1-3)
1. **Identify Core Team**
   - Find 5-10 committed organizers
   - Include potential drivers and restaurant partners
   - Connect with local cooperative development organizations

2. **Research Local Conditions**
   - Survey restaurants about delivery needs and pain points
   - Talk to current delivery drivers about their experiences
   - Analyze delivery patterns in your area
   - Understand local regulations

3. **Develop Initial Model**
   - Decide on worker co-op vs multi-stakeholder model
   - Set target commission rates (typically 5-15%)
   - Plan initial service area (start small)
   - Create basic financial projections

### Phase 2: Technical Infrastructure (Months 3-6)
1. **Platform Options**
   - **CoopCycle**: Open source, ready to deploy
   - **Karrot**: Community organizing platform adaptable for delivery
   - **Custom Build**: Use our [P2P architecture guide](/projects/p2p-platform.html)

2. **Essential Features**
   - Order management system
   - Driver dispatch algorithm (fair, not exploitative)
   - Payment processing (consider cooperative processors)
   - Customer communication tools

3. **Safety Systems**
   - Driver screening and training
   - Customer verification
   - Incident reporting system
   - Insurance requirements

### Phase 3: Pilot Launch (Months 6-9)
1. **Start Small**
   - 5-10 restaurants
   - 10-20 drivers
   - Single neighborhood
   - Limited hours initially

2. **Build Relationships**
   - Regular meetings with all stakeholders
   - Transparent communication about challenges
   - Celebrate early wins
   - Document lessons learned

3. **Refine Operations**
   - Adjust dispatch algorithms for fairness
   - Improve driver support systems
   - Streamline restaurant onboarding
   - Gather customer feedback

### Phase 4: Sustainable Growth (Months 9+)
1. **Expand Carefully**
   - Add neighborhoods systematically
   - Maintain quality over quantity
   - Ensure democratic participation scales
   - Build reserves before expanding

2. **Federation Opportunities**
   - Connect with other cities doing similar work
   - Share technology improvements
   - Coordinate advocacy efforts
   - Create mutual aid networks

## Financial Model

### Revenue Structure
- 5-15% commission from restaurants (vs 15-30% commercial)
- Small delivery fee to customers ($1-3)
- Membership model for frequent users
- Grants and community investment

### Cost Structure
- Driver wages and benefits (60-70% of revenue)
- Technology infrastructure (10-15%)
- Insurance and safety (10-15%)
- Administration and growth (5-10%)

### Path to Sustainability
- Break even with 50-100 active restaurants
- Reinvest surpluses in better wages and expansion
- Build community wealth instead of extracting it
