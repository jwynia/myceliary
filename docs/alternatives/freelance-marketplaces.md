# Community Alternatives to Freelance Marketplaces

Upwork, Fiverr, and similar platforms extract 20-30% fees while creating race-to-the-bottom pricing. Worker-owned alternatives can provide fair wages, professional development, and community support.

## The Problem with Corporate Freelance Platforms

### Exploitation Model
- **Upwork**: 10-20% fees plus payment holds
- **Fiverr**: 20% commission plus payment processing fees  
- **TaskRabbit**: 15-30% fees with no worker protections
- **99designs**: Spec work that devalues creative labor

### Impact on Workers
- Race to bottom pricing globally
- No collective bargaining power
- Arbitrary account suspensions
- Client holds all power in disputes
- Zero benefits or protections

### Systemic Issues
- Encourages precarious gig work over stable employment
- Undermines professional standards and rates
- Creates global labor arbitrage
- Extracts value from creative and technical work
- Prevents worker organizing
