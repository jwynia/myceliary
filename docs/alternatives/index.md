# Community Alternatives to Exploitative Apps

This section documents commercial applications with exploitative business models and provides practical guidance for building community-driven alternatives. Each category includes exploitation analysis, existing alternatives, and step-by-step implementation paths.

## Why Community Alternatives Matter

Many of today's most popular apps extract value from workers and communities while concentrating wealth and power. Community alternatives can:

- Return value to workers and users
- Prioritize safety and wellbeing over profit
- Build local economic resilience
- Demonstrate that another tech is possible

3. **Learn from Existing Models**: Study successful alternatives in other communities
4. **Start Small**: Begin with a pilot project to test your approach
5. **Build Democratically**: Ensure community ownership and control from the start
