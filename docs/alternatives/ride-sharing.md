# Community Alternatives to Ride Sharing Apps

Uber and Lyft extract 25-40% from every ride while drivers struggle to make minimum wage. Community-owned alternatives can provide fair wages, better safety, and local control.

## The Problem with Corporate Ride Sharing

### Exploitation Model
- **Uber**: Takes 25-40% commission, denies employee benefits
- **Lyft**: Similar commission structure, surge pricing that mainly benefits company
- **Via**: Corporate-focused model with minimal driver input

### Driver Reality
- Average earnings below minimum wage after expenses
- No benefits, sick leave, or protections
- Algorithmic management creates stress and unsafe conditions
- Drivers bear all vehicle costs and risks

### Community Impact
- Increases traffic congestion without reducing car ownership
- Undermines public transit funding
- Extracts wealth from local communities
- Creates precarious employment

## Successful Community Alternatives

### Eva (Montreal)
**Women-driven ride sharing cooperative**
- Founded by women, for women's safety
- Drivers are member-owners
- Flat membership fee instead of per-ride commission
- Reinvests profits in safety training and community programs

**Key Innovations**:
- Enhanced background checks
- Safety protocols developed by and for women
- Community accountability model
- Integration with local women's organizations

### Green Taxi Cooperative (Denver)
**800+ driver-owners strong**
- Drivers keep 100% of fares minus small overhead
- Democratic governance - one member, one vote
- Provides benefits and support services
- Competes successfully with Uber/Lyft

**Success Factors**:
- Started with existing taxi drivers
- Leveraged regulatory knowledge
- Built strong dispatch technology
- Created driver solidarity culture

### Platform Cooperatives Emerging
- **The Drivers Cooperative** (NYC): 6,000+ drivers, app-based
- **CabFair** (Portland): Union-backed alternative
- **Modo** (Vancouver): Car sharing co-op expanding to rides

## Building Your Own Community Ride Share

### Phase 1: Organizing Drivers (Months 1-3)

**1. Start with Core Group**
- Identify 20-30 committed drivers
- Mix of full-time and part-time drivers
- Include diverse communities and neighborhoods
- Connect with driver advocacy groups

**2. Understand Local Regulations**
- Research licensing requirements
- Understand insurance mandates
- Learn about airport and venue permissions
- Identify supportive city council members

**3. Choose Cooperative Model**
- **Worker Cooperative**: Drivers only
- **Multi-stakeholder**: Drivers, riders, community
- **Platform Cooperative**: Tech-enabled model
- Consider hybrid approaches

### Phase 2: Technical Platform (Months 3-6)

**Open Source Options**
1. **LibreTaxi**: Basic open-source ride matching
2. **Ride Austin** (archived): Non-profit model code available
3. **Custom Platform**: Use our [P2P architecture guide](/projects/p2p-platform.html)

**Essential Features**
- Rider-driver matching algorithm (fair, not manipulative)
- Real-time GPS tracking
- In-app payments with multiple options
- Rating system (mutual and transparent)
- Safety features (emergency button, ride sharing)

**Differentiating Features**
- Transparent pricing displayed upfront
- Driver destination preferences respected
- No surge pricing (or democratically controlled)
- Integration with public transit

### Phase 3: Safety Infrastructure (Months 4-7)

**Driver Safety**
- Comprehensive background checks
- But also paths for people with records
- Regular vehicle safety inspections
- Driver safety training programs
- Emergency support system

**Rider Safety**
- Identity verification options
- Ride tracking and sharing
- In-app emergency features
- Community accountability process
- Safe pickup/dropoff locations

**Community Safety**
- Integration with local safety networks
- Partnerships with community organizations
- Whisper network for problematic riders
- Restorative justice approach to conflicts

### Phase 4: Launch Strategy (Months 7-12)

**Pilot Approach**
1. Start with single neighborhood or corridor
2. Focus on underserved areas first
3. Build from community events and gatherings
4. Partner with local organizations

**Building Ridership**
- Emphasize community ownership
- Highlight driver welfare
- Promote price transparency
- Create membership benefits

**Sustainable Growth**
- Expand one neighborhood at a time
- Maintain service quality standards
- Keep democratic participation
- Build financial reserves

## Financial Sustainability

### Revenue Model
- **5-15% platform fee** (vs 25-40% corporate apps)
- **Membership options** for regular riders
- **Corporate accounts** with fair pricing
- **Event partnerships** with venues

### Driver Economics
- Drivers keep 85-95% of fares
- Transparent fee structure
- No algorithmic wage manipulation
- Collective benefits purchasing

### Community Investment
- Crowdfunding for initial capital
- Community bonds for expansion
- Revenue sharing with community organizations
- Local business partnerships

## Regulatory Navigation

### Common Challenges
1. **Insurance Requirements**
   - Form group policy
   - Work with cooperative insurers
   - Advocate for regulatory changes

2. **Licensing Mandates**
   - Support drivers in getting licenses
   - Create study groups
   - Challenge unfair requirements

3. **Airport Access**
   - Negotiate as collective
   - Partner with other cooperatives
   - Build political support

### Advocacy Strategy
- Build coalitions with labor unions
- Partner with environmental groups
- Engage rider communities
- Create compelling public narrative

## Technology Decisions

### Build vs Buy vs Fork
- **Build**: Maximum control, highest cost
- **Buy**: Faster launch, ongoing fees
- **Fork**: Balance of control and speed

### Key Technical Considerations
- Data ownership and privacy
- Algorithm transparency
- Interoperability with other systems
- Accessibility for all users
