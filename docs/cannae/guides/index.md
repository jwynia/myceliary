4. **Time Investment**: Can you sustain effort for 6+ months?
5. **Values Alignment**: Are you committed to non-extraction?

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Starting with technology instead of community
- Accepting venture capital or extractive funding

- Competing instead of collaborating
- Focusing on scale over community benefit

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need technical expertise to use these guides?**
A: Basic technical knowledge helps, but the guides emphasize finding technical allies. Community organizing skills are more important than coding ability.

**Q: Can these work in my small town/big city?**
A: Yes! Each guide includes adaptations for different contexts. The key is matching the opportunity to your community's specific needs.

**Q: How do we fund these projects without compromising values?**
A: Each guide includes detailed non-extractive funding strategies. See our [Funding Resources](/resources/funding) for more options.

**Q: What if we fail?**
A: Failure is learning! Document what didn't work and share with the movement. Your "failure" saves others time and helps refine approaches.
