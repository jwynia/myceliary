```

**Time Required**: 6-9 months  
**Budget Needed**: $5,000-10,000  
**Team Size**: 2-3 developers + craft practitioners  
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)

## Phase 1: Community Foundation (Month 1)

### Week 1-2: Identify Your Craft Community

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Craft Communities))
    Traditional Crafts
      Woodworking
      Textile Arts
      Pottery
      Metalwork
    Food Crafts
      Baking
      Brewing

```

**Action Steps**:
1. **Map Local Craft Communities**
   - Visit maker spaces and craft guilds
   - Check community centers and libraries
   - Search social media groups
   - Talk to local artisan shops

2. **Initial Conversations**
   - "What parts of your craft are most challenging?"
   - "What knowledge might be lost without intervention?"
   - "Where could tools help without replacing skill?"
   - "What would 'success' look like for you?"

3. **Document Findings**
   ```
   Craft: [Name]
   Practitioners: [Number]
   Key Challenges: [List]
   Augmentation Opportunities: [List]
   Community Assets: [List]
   ```

### Week 3-4: Build Trust and Understanding

```mermaid

    C --> D[Understand]
    D --> E[Co-Create]

    style E fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#9c27b0,stroke-width:2px
```

**Trust Building Activities**:
- Attend craft sessions as observer/learner
- Share your own making experiences
- Be transparent about project goals
- Emphasize community ownership from start

## Phase 2: Co-Design Process (Months 2-3)

### Design Principles Workshop

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Augmentation Principles] --> B[Enhance Don't Replace]
    A --> C[Preserve Craft Knowledge]
    A --> D[Support Learning]

    C --> H[Document Master Techniques]
    D --> I[Teach While Doing]
    E --> J[Honor Cultural Context]
    F --> K[Explore New Possibilities]
```

**Workshop Agenda** (Half Day):
1. **Welcome & Introductions** (30 min)
2. **Principles Discussion** (60 min)
   - What must never be automated?
   - What enhancement would be helpful?
   - How do we preserve craft spirit?
3. **Brainstorming Session** (90 min)
   - Specific augmentation ideas
   - Priority ranking exercise
   - Technical feasibility discussion
4. **Governance Planning** (60 min)
   - Decision-making structure
   - Ownership model
   - Benefit sharing

### Technical Specification Development

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CRAFTER ||--o{ TOOL : uses
    TOOL ||--o{ FEATURE : contains
    FEATURE ||--o{ DATA : generates
    DATA ||--o{ INSIGHT : produces
    INSIGHT ||--o{ CRAFTER : benefits
    
    CRAFTER {
        string name
        string skill_level
        string specialization
    }
    TOOL {
        string name
        string purpose
        boolean offline_capable
    }
    FEATURE {
        string function
        string enhancement_type
        boolean optional
    }
```

**Key Technical Decisions**:

| Aspect | Options | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Platform** | Mobile app, Web app, Desktop software | Start with web (accessible) |
| **AI Type** | Cloud AI, Local AI, Hybrid | Local-first with optional cloud |
| **Data Storage** | User device, Community server, Cloud | User-controlled with backup |
| **Open Source** | Fully open, Partially open, Closed | Fully open from day one |

## Phase 3: Prototype Development (Months 4-6)

### Minimum Viable Augmentation (MVA)

```mermaid

    subgraph "Woodworking Example"
    A[Wood Image Input] --> B[AI Analysis]
    B --> C[Grain Pattern Detection]
    B --> D[Defect Identification]
    B --> E[Cut Optimization]
    C --> F[Suggestion Display]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Crafter Decision]
    end
    
    style A fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#ffc107,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#d4edda,stroke:#28a745,stroke-width:2px
```

**Development Approach**:
1. **Start Simple**
   - One craft, one augmentation
   - Basic UI, focus on function
   - Real device testing early
   - Crafter feedback loops

2. **Privacy First**
   ```javascript
   // Example: Local-first architecture
   const augmentationEngine = {
     processImage: async (imageData) => {
       // Process locally on device
       const analysis = await localAI.analyze(imageData);
       // No data leaves device
       return analysis;
     },
     saveToDevice: (data) => {
       // User controls all data
       localStorage.setItem('craftData', data);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Iterative Testing**
   - Weekly crafter sessions
   - A/B testing features
   - Performance metrics
   - Usability studies

### Community Testing Protocol

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Crafter
    participant T as Tool
    participant D as Developer
    participant G as Group
    
    C->>T: Uses prototype
    T->>C: Provides augmentation
    C->>D: Gives feedback
    D->>T: Makes improvements
    D->>G: Shares updates
    G->>D: Collective input
    D->>T: Implements changes
```

## Phase 4: Community Deployment (Months 7-9)

```

**Monthly Review Questions**:
1. Are crafters using the tool to enhance their work?
2. Is traditional knowledge being preserved/shared?
3. Are new crafters learning faster?
4. Is the community growing stronger?
5. Do crafters feel more empowered?

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Technical Intimidation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Fear of Technology] --> B[Start with Familiar]
    B --> C[Phone Camera Example]
    C --> D[Simple Enhancement]
    D --> E[Build Confidence]
    E --> F[Gradual Complexity]
```

**Solution Approach**:
- Begin with tools they already use
- Make first interaction magical but simple
- Celebrate small successes
- Peer support groups

### Challenge: Maintaining Craft Authenticity

**Solution Framework**:
- Crafters define authenticity boundaries
- Tool suggests, never decides
- Traditional methods always available
- Enhancement optional, not required

### Challenge: Sustainable Funding

```mermaid
pie title "Diversified Funding Model"
    "Member Dues" : 30
    "Workshop Fees" : 25
    "Grants" : 20
    "Product Sales" : 15
    "Donations" : 10
