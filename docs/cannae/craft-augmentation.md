{: .fs-9 }

AI that respects your expertise and amplifies your craft—on your terms

## The Control Principle: Who Decides What Gets Augmented?

The fundamental difference between our approach and capitalist automation isn't the technology—it's **who controls it**.

### Augmentation (Worker-Controlled)
- **You choose** which tasks to enhance or delegate
- **You decide** what brings joy and stays manual
- **You benefit** from freed time and energy
- **You own** the tools and the improvements

### Automation (Boss-Imposed)
- Management imposes technology to cut costs
- Decisions made without worker input
- Technology replaces people who want to work
- Benefits flow to owners, workers get displaced

**When a woodworker decides they want help analyzing grain patterns but keeps hand-carving because they love it—that's augmentation.**

**When a factory owner buys CNC machines to fire woodworkers—that's automation.**

## The Problem We're Solving

Capitalism sees craft work as inefficient—something to be automated away. They promise "liberation from drudgery" while actually liberating profits from workers. Their AI solutions aim to:

- Replace skilled craftspeople entirely
- Standardize unique, personal work
- Extract craft knowledge without compensation
- Turn meaningful work into commodity production

But craftspeople don't need to be "liberated" from work they love. They need tools that **free up time for the parts they enjoy most**.

## Our Solution: The Intelligent Apprentice

Instead of AI that replaces, we're building AI that respects. Think of it as an intelligent apprentice that:

- **Learns what you want help with** (not what someone else decides)
- **Handles the tedious parts** you'd rather skip
- **Enhances your creativity** without imposing solutions
- **Preserves your expertise** and amplifies your skills
- **Keeps you in control** of every decision

This isn't about making craft "more efficient." It's about giving craftspeople power over their own work.

## How You Stay in Control

### 1. Task Selection Control
**You decide what gets augmented**
- Choose which tasks to delegate to AI
- Keep the work that brings satisfaction
- Change your mind anytime
- No forced automation

*Example*: A potter chooses glaze chemistry help but shapes every piece by hand.

### 2. Suggestion, Not Direction
**AI proposes, you dispose**
- All AI output is suggestions
- You make every creative decision
- Override anything instantly
- AI learns your preferences

*Example*: AI suggests wood joints, but the woodworker chooses which to use.

### 3. Skill-Appropriate Assistance
**Help that matches your level**
- Beginners get more guidance
- Masters get subtle enhancements
- You control the assistance level
- Grow at your own pace

*Example*: New weavers get pattern help, experienced ones get tension monitoring.

### 4. Knowledge Sovereignty
**Your expertise stays yours**
- You own all your craft data
- Share knowledge only if you choose
- No extraction without permission
- Attribution always maintained

*Example*: Your unique techniques remain your intellectual property.

### 5. Economic Control
**Benefits flow to you**
- You own the augmentation tools
- Increased value goes to you
- No platform fees or lock-in
- Cooperative economic models

*Example*: Better work means higher prices for you, not higher profits for bosses.
