# Collective Intelligence Amplifiers: Group Wisdom Over Individual Productivity
{: .fs-9 }

AI that amplifies what communities know together, not what individuals can produce alone
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## The Opportunity

**Exploits**: Individual Productivity Obsession  
**Their Blind Spot**: "AI should make individuals more productive"  
**Our Approach**: AI that amplifies group wisdom and collective decision-making

While Big Tech focuses on making individuals more productive consumers and producers, communities need tools that enhance collective intelligence, democratic participation, and group wisdom. This creates perfect opportunities for AI that serves the group mind rather than individual competition.

## Why This Works

### Capitalist Blind Spots We Exploit

1. **Individual Focus**: They can't see value beyond personal optimization
2. **Competition Obsession**: They miss benefits of cooperation
3. **Quantified Self**: They ignore collective wisdom and intuition  
4. **Efficiency Metrics**: They can't measure community health and solidarity

1. **Input Gathering**: Multiple ways for residents to share priorities and ideas
2. **Pattern Recognition**: AI identifies shared values and emerging consensus
3. **Synthesis Support**: Complex proposals broken down for collective understanding
4. **Consensus Building**: Real-time feedback on community agreement levels
5. **Decision Integration**: Final choices reflect authentic collective wisdom

**Technical Features**:
- Multilingual input and output for inclusive participation
- Anonymous option to encourage honest input
- Real-time visualization of community priorities and consensus
- Integration with in-person meetings and traditional decision-making
- Community control over all algorithms and data

**Results After 2 Years**:
- Participation increased from 200 to 800+ residents
- Decision satisfaction ratings improved from 6.2 to 8.7/10
- More complex projects successfully implemented
- Residents report feeling more connected to neighborhood
- Model replicated in 5 other communities

### Community Ownership Features
