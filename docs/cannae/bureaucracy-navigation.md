{: .fs-9 }

AI that democratizes access to resources by breaking down administrative barriers
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## The Opportunity

**Exploits:** Professional Expertise Gatekeeping  
**Their Blind Spot:** "Complex processes require expensive experts"  
**Our Opportunity:** AI-powered assistant that guides communities through bureaucratic mazes  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Design Phase (Stage 3)

## Problem Space

### The Current Reality

Accessing essential resources requires:
- **Legal knowledge** most people don't have
- **$1,000-$5,000+** in professional fees
- **Months or years** of administrative burden
- **Technical writing skills** for applications
- **Understanding bureaucratic language** designed to exclude

This creates a system where those who need resources most are least able to access them.

### The Capitalist Failure

The market has failed because:
- Those who need help can't afford professional services
- Existing tools (LegalZoom, consultants) target those with money
- Professional gatekeepers profit from maintaining complexity
- Government has no incentive to simplify
- Current AI tools cost $179-$199/month

### The Community Impact

- **30%** of nonprofits fail due to administrative burdens
- **2+ years** average wait for Section 8 housing
- **<10%** grant success rate for small organizations
- Rural and marginalized communities face additional barriers
- Organizations spend more time on paperwork than serving communities

## Why This Matters

Every hour a community organizer spends on paperwork is an hour not spent serving their community. Every person denied benefits due to administrative complexity is a failure of our systems. This tool transforms AI from a force for automation and extraction into one for liberation and empowerment.

By making bureaucratic navigation accessible to all, we:
- **Level the playing field** between resourced and under-resourced communities
- **Build collective power** through shared knowledge
- **Free up energy** for actual community work
- **Demonstrate** AI's potential for liberation
