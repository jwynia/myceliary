# Cannae Opportunities: AI That Exploits Capitalist Vulnerabilities
{: .fs-9 }

Technologies that turn capitalism's greatest strengths into its greatest weaknesses
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## What Are Cannae Opportunities?

Drawing from Joan Westenberg's analysis of the Cannae Problem - where success creates the very blind spots that lead to failure - we've identified 8 specific vulnerabilities in how capitalism approaches technology. Each vulnerability represents an opportunity to build community-controlled alternatives that capitalism literally cannot comprehend or compete with.

> "Success creates its own failure mechanisms. The very things that make you successful produce the blind spots that make you vulnerable." - Joan Westenberg

## The 8 Opportunities

### üåê Ready Now (Start Today)

#### [1. Augmentation Not Automation](augmentation-not-automation)
**Exploits**: Automation Absolutism  
**Their Blind Spot**: "Automate everything possible"  
**Our Opportunity**: AI that enhances human craft and judgment rather than replacing it  
**Example**: Craft augmentation tools that preserve artisan skills while improving sustainability

#### [2. Hyperlocal AI Federations](hyperlocal-ai)
**Exploits**: Scale-or-Die Mentality  
**Their Blind Spot**: "If it doesn't scale globally, it's worthless"  
**Our Opportunity**: Intentionally unscalable AI for specific neighborhoods  
**Example**: Community garden AI that knows your exact soil and microclimate

#### [3. Liberation Software](liberation-software)
**Exploits**: Engagement Maximization Trap  
**Their Blind Spot**: "Success = maximum user engagement"  
**Our Opportunity**: Tools designed to make themselves unnecessary  
**Example**: Language learning AI that celebrates when you no longer need it

### ü§ù Ready with Partners

#### [4. Federated Community AI Networks](federated-ai-networks)
**Exploits**: AI Centralization Orthodoxy  
**Their Blind Spot**: "AI requires massive centralized compute"  
**Our Opportunity**: Small, distributed AI serving specific communities  
**Example**: Indigenous language preservation networks

#### [5. Collective Intelligence Amplifiers](collective-intelligence)
**Exploits**: Individual Productivity Obsession  
**Their Blind Spot**: "AI should make individuals more productive"  
**Our Opportunity**: AI that amplifies group wisdom and consensus  
**Example**: Participatory budgeting with emergence detection

#### [6. Careful AI Development](careful-ai-development)
**Exploits**: Innovation Speed Cult  
**Their Blind Spot**: "Move fast and break things"  
**Our Opportunity**: Slow, community-governed AI deployment  
**Example**: Elder care AI developed with mandatory community review periods

### üèóÔ∏è Foundation Building

#### [7. Data Dignity Cooperatives](data-dignity-cooperatives)
**Exploits**: Data Monetization Imperative  
**Their Blind Spot**: "Data is the new oil - extract and refine"  
**Our Opportunity**: Communities own their collective intelligence  
**Example**: Medical AI cooperatives where patients control insights

#### [8. Portable Identity Commons](portable-identity)
**Exploits**: Platform Lock-in Strategy  
**Their Blind Spot**: "Control the platform, control the value"  
**Our Opportunity**: User-owned identity and reputation  
**Example**: Gig worker reputation that travels between platforms

## Why These Work

```

Each opportunity works because it violates fundamental assumptions that capitalism cannot question without undermining its own logic:

1. **They optimize for extraction** ‚Üí We optimize for liberation
2. **They centralize control** ‚Üí We distribute sovereignty  
3. **They maximize engagement** ‚Üí We celebrate graduation
4. **They scale infinitely** ‚Üí We serve specifically
5. **They automate humans out** ‚Üí We augment humans in

## Getting Started

### For Communities

1. **Assess Your Needs**: Which capitalist blindspot affects your community most?
2. **Start Small**: Begin with "Ready Now" opportunities that require minimal resources
3. **Find Partners**: Connect with other communities facing similar challenges
4. **Access Resources**: Download implementation guides and technical specifications

### For Developers

1. **Choose Your Battle**: Pick an opportunity that matches your skills and values
2. **Join the Movement**: Connect with communities ready to implement
3. **Contribute Code**: All specifications are open source and need builders
4. **Share Knowledge**: Document your implementation for others

### For Organizers

1. **Map Vulnerabilities**: Identify which mental models dominate your sector
2. **Build Coalitions**: Unite communities around specific opportunities
3. **Resource Mobilization**: Access non-extractive funding sources
4. **Movement Building**: Use implementations to demonstrate alternatives

## Implementation Support

Each opportunity includes:
- üìã **Technical Specification**: Complete architecture and requirements
- üé® **Design Patterns**: User experience optimized for communities
- üîß **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- üí∞ **Resource Calculator**: Estimate costs and requirements
- ü§ù **Community Templates**: Governance and decision-making tools

## Success Stories

*As communities implement these opportunities, we'll share their stories here*

## Join the Revolution

These aren't just technical projects - they're acts of resistance. Each implementation demonstrates that another technological world is possible, one that serves human needs rather than capital accumulation.
