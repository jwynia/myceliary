# High-Leverage Community Technology Projects

Myceliary identifies and prioritizes foundational library, SDK, and hosted application projects that can accelerate the development of community-controlled alternatives to exploitative corporate platforms.

## Overview

These high-leverage projects provide maximum second-order effects by enabling hundreds of locally adapted implementations from shared foundational infrastructure, dramatically accelerating community-controlled alternatives to exploitative platforms.

</pre>

**Phase 1: Foundation Building (Immediate - Year 1)**
- Platform cooperation libraries enabling rapid community alternative development
- Community currency hosting providing immediate economic alternative infrastructure
- Mutual aid coordination hosting supporting existing community organizing

**Phase 2: Economic Alternative Infrastructure (Years 1-2)**
- Cooperative management platforms supporting worker and housing cooperative development
- Community investment hosting enabling local capital circulation
- Resource optimization libraries maximizing community resource sharing

**Phase 3: Coordination and Intelligence (Years 2-3)**
- Federated knowledge commons enabling cross-community learning
- Crisis response coordination providing sophisticated emergency response capabilities
- Corporate accountability tools strengthening community resistance efforts

**Phase 4: Sovereignty and Integration (Years 3+)**
- Communication sovereignty infrastructure reducing dependence on corporate platforms
- Community data sovereignty providing complete alternative to corporate data extraction
- Movement coordination platforms integrating community technology with broader strategy

## Success Metrics

### Community Empowerment Indicators
- Number of communities successfully deploying community-controlled alternatives
- Reduction in community dependence on exploitative corporate platforms
- Increase in community economic self-determination
- Growth in community technical and political capacity

### Network and Federation Effectiveness
- Cross-community coordination and resource sharing
- Innovation transfer and adaptation speed
- Resilience and mutual aid during crises
- Collective power building through coordinated technology development

### Anti-Capitalist Impact
- Market share gained by community alternatives
- Economic value retained within communities rather than extracted by corporations
- Political and economic power redistributed toward community control
- Integration with broader anti-capitalist organizing and movement building
