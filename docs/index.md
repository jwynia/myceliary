# Myceliary

Welcome to Myceliary, a research project dedicated to exploring anti-capitalist frameworks and patterns in AI/ML development. Our goal is to analyze and understand how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be developed and deployed in ways that prioritize social good over profit motives.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a platform for:
- Researching anti-capitalist approaches to AI/ML development
- Documenting patterns and frameworks that support ethical AI practices
- Building a knowledge base of case studies and theoretical frameworks
- Fostering discussion around socially responsible technology
