# Analysis Frameworks

The Myceliary project develops systematic frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and building AI applications that serve human needs outside of capitalist structures. Our frameworks help communities and technologists discover opportunities where AI could genuinely serve liberation rather than extraction.

## Anti-Capitalist AI Applications Framework

Our primary framework for identifying AI applications that operate outside capitalist incentive structures.

### Key Components

#### Market Failure Spaces
- Public goods and commons management
- Care work and emotional labor
- Community resilience and mutual aid
- Environmental stewardship
- Knowledge preservation and sharing

#### Counter-Hegemonic Applications
- Alternative economic coordination
- Collective organizing and solidarity networks
- Resource redistribution mechanisms
- Corporate accountability tools

#### Democratization Vectors
- Decentralized decision-making
- Skill and knowledge commons
- Community self-governance tools
- Direct democracy facilitation

### Application Process

1. **Identify the Gap** - What human need is currently unmet or poorly served?
2. **Analyze the Failure** - Why isn't capitalism addressing this need adequately?
3. **Map Power Relations** - Who benefits from the current situation and who suffers?
4. **Explore AI Potential** - How could AI/LLM capabilities address the underlying issue?
5. **Design for Anti-Capture** - What features would prevent commodification?
6. **Test Community Fit** - Does this actually serve identified community needs?
7. **Plan for Sustainability** - How can this exist outside capitalist frameworks?
8. **Assess Ecological Impact** - What are the environmental considerations?
9. **Security Planning** - How does this function under crisis conditions?
10. **Network Integration** - How does this connect with other anti-capitalist tools?

## Capitalist Trap Detector Framework

A systematic approach to identifying when AI solutions that appear helpful actually serve capitalist interests.

### Trap Categories

#### The Efficiency Trap
Solutions that promise to make existing exploitative systems more efficient rather than questioning their fundamental structure.

#### The Individualization Trap
Converts collective problems into individual technical solutions, obscuring systemic causes.

#### The Platform Dependency Trap
Creates dependence on corporate-controlled infrastructure while appearing to empower users.

#### The Data Extraction Trap
Provides services in exchange for data that becomes a source of profit or control.

#### The Innovation Theater Trap
Generates excitement about technological progress while maintaining existing power structures.

#### The Gatekeeping Trap
Creates new forms of access control while appearing to democratize resources.

### Evaluation Tools

#### Red Flag Checklist
Immediate disqualifiers include:
- Corporate platform dependency for core functionality
- Unnecessary personal or community data collection
- Centralized decision-making power
- Funding from sources with conflicting interests
- Increased surveillance capabilities
- Individualization of collective problems

#### Green Flag Indicators
Positive anti-capitalist features include:
- Community-controlled governance
- Minimal data collection with strong privacy
- Independence from corporate infrastructure
- Strengthening of collective capacity
- Addressing root causes of problems
- Integration of diverse knowledge systems

## Research Query Framework

A structured approach to conducting research and monitoring for anti-capitalist AI applications.

### Research Categories
- Basic Web Search - Simple queries for foundational information
- News Search - Current events and emerging trends
- Light Research Report - Focused synthesis on specific topics
- Standard Research Report - Comparative analysis across perspectives
- Deep Research Report - Comprehensive analysis with multiple sources
- Academic Literature Review - Scholarly sources and theoretical frameworks
- Case Study Analysis - Detailed examination of implementations

### Research Areas
- One-Time Foundational Research
- Ongoing Monitoring
- Crisis and Event-Driven Research
- Geographic and Cultural Context
- Sector-Specific Applications

## Framework Application

Our frameworks are designed to be used together:

1. Use the **Anti-Capitalist Framework** to identify potential applications
2. Apply the **Capitalist Trap Detector** to evaluate and strengthen solutions
3. Use the **Research Query Framework** to investigate specific opportunities

### Example Applications

- Mutual aid coordination systems
- Community resource sharing platforms
- Collective decision-making tools
- Knowledge commons management
- Environmental monitoring systems
- Care work coordination networks

## Framework Development

These frameworks are continuously refined through:
- Testing in specific community organizing contexts
- Feedback from technologists working on alternative projects
- Case study analysis of successful and failed attempts
- Integration with broader anti-capitalist theory

## Get Involved

Our frameworks are living documents that improve through community use and feedback. If you're using these frameworks in your work:

- Share your experiences and insights
- Contribute case studies of applications
- Suggest improvements or additions
- Help identify new patterns or traps
