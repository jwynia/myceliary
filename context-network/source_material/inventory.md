## Purpose
This document catalogs all source materials used in the analysis project, providing a central reference for the materials being analyzed.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Source Material
- **Source Type:** Mixed
- **Analysis Stage:** Raw
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established
- **Relevance:** Critical

## Content

### Overview

This inventory tracks all source materials that are part of the analysis scope. Each material is cataloged with key metadata to facilitate reference and retrieval.

### Inventory Table
