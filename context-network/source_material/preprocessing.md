### Preprocessing Guidelines

1. **Preserve Original Materials**
   - Always maintain the original, unmodified source materials
   - Create separate copies for preprocessing
   - Document the location of both original and preprocessed versions

2. **Document All Steps**
   - Record all preprocessing steps applied to each material
   - Include tool versions and parameter settings
   - Note any issues encountered and how they were addressed

3. **Validate Results**
   - Verify that preprocessing preserves essential information
   - Check for unintended side effects or distortions
   - Compare samples of preprocessed output with original material

4. **Consider Analysis Needs**
   - Tailor preprocessing to the specific analysis goals
   - Balance preprocessing thoroughness with analysis requirements
   - Consult with analysts about specific preprocessing needs

5. **Handle Sensitive Information**
   - Identify and properly handle sensitive or confidential information
   - Apply appropriate anonymization or redaction techniques
   - Document any information that was removed or modified
