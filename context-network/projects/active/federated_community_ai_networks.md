# Federated Community AI Networks - Project Status

## Overview
- **Strategic Opportunity**: [Cannae AI Opportunities - AI Centralization Orthodoxy](../../analysis/findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md#1-the-ai-centralization-orthodoxy)
- **Primary Communities**: TBD - seeking communities with AI/translation/local knowledge needs
- **Current Stage**: üìñ Complete Implementation Documentation Ready
- **Next Milestone**: Real community validation and pilot deployment
- **Community Contact**: TBD - establishing community relationships

## Cannae Vulnerability Being Exploited

**Their Mental Model**: "AI requires massive centralized compute and data"

**The Vulnerability**: 
- Dismisses distributed AI approaches as "toy" solutions
- Cannot conceive of AI that improves without harvesting user data
- Blind to collaborative learning without centralization

**Our Strategic Position**: Build small, federated AI that serves specific community needs better than any centralized system could, while keeping communities in control of their data and knowledge.

## Current Focus: Community Needs Validation

### Potential Community Types to Engage
1. **Language Communities**: Communities wanting to preserve or translate local languages/dialects
2. **Knowledge Preservation Communities**: Indigenous communities, elders' groups, cultural preservation groups
3. **Local Intelligence Communities**: Neighborhood groups, community gardens, local resource sharing networks
4. **Educational Communities**: Community learning centers, alternative schools, skill-sharing networks

### Specific Potential Pilot Communities
Based on community AI research, prioritized opportunities:

**High-Priority Candidates:**
1. **Indigenous Language Communities**: 
   - Communities already working on language preservation with AI
   - Strong governance structures and data sovereignty values
   - Clear need for community-controlled AI that respects cultural protocols
   - Example: Follow Cherokee Nation or Blackfeet Community College models

2. **Community Learning Centers**: 
   - Organizations providing alternative education in underserved areas
   - Need for AI tutoring that understands local context and culture
   - Democratic governance structures compatible with community AI control
   - Example: Community-based literacy programs, immigrant education centers

3. **Cooperative Networks**: 
   - Platform cooperatives already committed to democratic governance
   - Need for AI coordination tools for cooperative operations
   - Existing technology infrastructure and governance experience
   - Example: Worker cooperatives, housing cooperatives, food cooperatives

**Medium-Priority Candidates:**
4. **Community Gardens/Food Networks**: 
   - Need for local knowledge AI about growing conditions, seed sharing, etc.
   - Strong community governance and mutual aid practices
   - Local knowledge that benefits from community-controlled preservation
   - Example: Urban garden networks, community supported agriculture

5. **Mutual Aid Networks**: 
   - Need for AI coordination of resources, skills, and crisis response
   - Strong anti-capitalist values and community control preferences
   - Existing democratic decision-making processes
   - Example: Disaster response networks, community defense groups

### Validation Questions for Communities
1. **Language & Communication Needs**:
   - Do you have translation needs between languages/dialects?
   - Are there local terms, phrases, or knowledge that mainstream AI doesn't understand?
   - Would community-controlled language AI serve your communication needs?

2. **Knowledge & Learning Needs**:
   - Do you have local knowledge that could benefit from AI organization/access?
   - Are there community learning needs that personalized AI could support?
   - Would community-controlled educational AI serve your learning goals?

3. **Community Intelligence Needs**:
   - Do you have local information that could be better organized/shared?
   - Are there community coordination tasks that AI could support?
   - Would community-controlled coordination AI serve your organizing needs?

4. **Community Control & Governance**:
   - How important is community control over AI that serves your needs?
   - What governance structures would communities need for AI systems?
   - How would communities want to share learnings with other communities?
