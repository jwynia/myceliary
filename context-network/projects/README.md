## Project Validation Framework

### Community Control Validation
At each project milestone:
- [ ] Communities have meaningful input into decisions
- [ ] Communities retain veto power over major changes
- [ ] Community capacity is being built, not dependency
- [ ] Community values and practices are respected
- [ ] Communities can evolve and adapt the project

### Anti-Capitalist Validation
At each project milestone:
- [ ] Project resists value extraction attempts
- [ ] Community control is maintained and strengthened
- [ ] Commons and mutual aid are enhanced
- [ ] No capitalist dependencies are introduced
- [ ] Project aligns with anti-capitalist framework

### Technical Quality Validation
At each project milestone:
- [ ] Technical approach is sound and community-maintainable
