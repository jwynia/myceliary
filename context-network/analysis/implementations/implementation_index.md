## Implementation Patterns

### Liberation Software Pattern
Systems designed to reduce their own necessity over time:
- Measure success by user independence
- Progressive reduction of system interaction
- Graduation as primary goal
- Community-controlled completion criteria

### Federation Architecture Pattern
Distributed systems that resist centralization:
- Local community control
- Interoperable standards
- Shared protocols, local adaptations
- Horizontal scaling through federation

### Gift Economy Integration Pattern
Systems that strengthen rather than commodify relationships:
- Optional time banking
- No ratings or reviews
- Focus on mutual aid
- Vouching over verification
