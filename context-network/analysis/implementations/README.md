# Implementations Directory

## Purpose
This directory bridges strategic analysis with concrete implementation, providing structured pathways from Cannae-style opportunity identification through production deployment.

## Directory Structure

### technical_specifications/
Detailed technical architecture documents that translate strategic opportunities into actionable development plans.

**Contents:**
- System architecture diagrams
- API specifications
- Data models and database schemas
- Security and privacy requirements
- Integration requirements
- Community governance technical requirements

### design_documents/
User experience and system design documentation.

**Contents:**
- UI/UX mockups and wireframes
- User journey maps
- Interaction design specifications
- Accessibility requirements
- Community input integration processes
- Design system documentation

### proof_of_concepts/
Prototype documentation and validation learnings.

**Contents:**
- Minimal viable feature specifications
- Implementation learnings and challenges
- Community validation results
- Technical feasibility assessments
- Iteration plans and next steps
- Resource requirements for production

### production_guides/
Complete implementation guides for community deployment.

**Contents:**
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Community governance setup guides
- Maintenance and operation procedures
- Scaling considerations
- Security hardening guidelines
- Community training materials

## Development Lifecycle

### Stage Progression
1. **Strategic Opportunity** (from ../findings/) → Technical Specification
2. **Technical Specification** → Design Document
3. **Design Document** → Proof of Concept
4. **Proof of Concept** → Production Guide

### Quality Gates
Each stage requires:
- Community needs validation
- Anti-capitalist framework alignment check
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Resource requirement analysis
- Security and privacy review

### Templates
Each subdirectory contains template files for consistent documentation structure.

## Integration Points

### With Planning Framework
- Links to ../planning/high_leverage_projects.md for strategic prioritization
- Connects with resource allocation and timeline planning

### With Research Archives
- Cites supporting research from ../research_archives/
- Documents community needs research and validation

### With Frameworks
- Applies ../frameworks/anti_capitalist_framework.md throughout development
- Uses ../frameworks/capitalist_trap_detector.md for continuous validation

## Anti-Capitalist Development Principles

All implementations must:
1. **Community Control**: Communities control governance and evolution
2. **Data Dignity**: Users/communities own their data and insights
3. **Resistance to Extraction**: Built-in safeguards against commodification
4. **Federated Autonomy**: Works independently while enabling connection
5. **Care-Centered**: Prioritizes relationships and wellbeing over efficiency
6. **Crisis Resilient**: Functions during system failures and emergencies

## Usage Guidelines

### Starting New Implementation
1. Select opportunity from ../findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md
2. Create technical specification using template
3. Validate community need and anti-capitalist alignment
4. Progress through design → prototype → production stages

### Community Engagement
- Include affected communities in all stages
- Use consensus-building processes for major decisions
- Maintain community veto power over implementation choices
- Document community input and decision rationale

### Documentation Standards
- Use provided templates for consistency
- Link extensively to research and analysis foundations
- Document community governance requirements
- Include security and privacy considerations
- Plan for long-term community maintenance
