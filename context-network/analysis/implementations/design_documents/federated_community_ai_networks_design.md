## Community Research

### Community Needs Assessment
**Method**: Participatory design sessions with priority community types
**Participants**: Representatives from Indigenous language communities, cooperatives, mutual aid networks
**Key Findings**:
- **Finding 1**: Communities want AI that speaks their language, not just translates it
- **Finding 2**: Democratic control more important than advanced features
- **Finding 3**: Privacy and data sovereignty are non-negotiable
- **Finding 4**: Must work on existing community devices and networks
- **Finding 5**: Visual design should reflect community identity, not tech aesthetics

### User Personas (Community-Defined)

- **Goals**: Preserve language for future generations, teach youth
- **Challenges**: Tech companies don't understand cultural protocols
- **Technology Relationship**: Cautious but willing if community controls it
- **Community Role**: Teacher, cultural advisor, governance council member

#### Persona 2: Jamal - Cooperative Coordinator
- **Background**: Organizes worker cooperative, manages resources
- **Goals**: Coordinate work efficiently while maintaining democracy
- **Challenges**: Corporate tools optimize for bosses, not workers
- **Technology Relationship**: Tech-savvy but values community control
- **Community Role**: Facilitator, technical liaison, conflict mediator

#### Persona 3: Chen - Mutual Aid Organizer
- **Background**: Coordinates disaster response and resource sharing
- **Goals**: Quick crisis response while protecting vulnerable members
- **Challenges**: Corporate platforms harvest data about vulnerable people
- **Technology Relationship**: Pragmatic - uses what works for community
- **Community Role**: Crisis responder, resource coordinator, trust builder

#### Persona 4: Amara - Youth Learner
- **Background**: High school student learning heritage language
- **Goals**: Connect with elders, learn in culturally appropriate ways
- **Challenges**: School AI doesn't understand her community's dialect
- **Technology Relationship**: Digital native but critical of tech exploitation
- **Community Role**: Bridge between generations, future leader

### Community Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Language Preservation Session
**Context**: Weekly language class mixing elders and youth
**Participants**: Maria (teacher), Amara and other youth (learners)
**Current Process**: Elders speak, youth try to write phonetically, much is lost
**Desired Process**: AI helps capture pronunciation, suggests spellings, remembers variations
**System Role**: Records with consent, learns from corrections, builds community dictionary

#### Scenario 2: Cooperative Work Coordination
**Context**: Monday planning meeting for worker cooperative
**Participants**: Jamal and 15 worker-owners
**Current Process**: Spreadsheets and corporate tools that don't support democracy
**Desired Process**: AI helps track decisions, suggests fair task distribution
**System Role**: Facilitates consensus, remembers past decisions, ensures equity

#### Scenario 3: Crisis Response Activation
**Context**: Flood warning requires rapid mutual aid coordination
**Participants**: Chen and network of 50+ mutual aid volunteers
**Current Process**: Phone trees and social media (surveillance risk)
**Desired Process**: Secure AI coordination matching needs with resources
**System Role**: Private matching, resource optimization, volunteer coordination

## Information Architecture

### Content Strategy
- **Community Voice**: AI speaks in community's linguistic patterns
- **Language Approach**: Respectful, non-extractive, consent-focused
- **Information Hierarchy**: Community governance first, features second
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Interfaces adapt to community cultural practices

- Visual and audio notifications options

**Cultural Adaptation**: 
- Configurable decision timelines (some communities decide slowly)
- Different consensus models (full, modified, delegated)
- Culturally appropriate conflict resolution options

#### Resource Sharing
**Flow**:
1. Member posts need or offer
2. AI suggests matches based on past patterns
3. Members confirm or modify matches
4. Exchange coordinated with privacy protection
5. Community feedback strengthens future matching

**Feedback**:
- Anonymous matching until both parties consent
- Trust indicators based on past exchanges
- Celebration of successful shares

**Trust Building**:
- Start with low-stakes exchanges
- Build reputation through successful shares
- Community vouching system for new members

**Gift Economy**:
- No tracking of "debt" or "credit"
- Emphasis on abundance and circulation
- Celebration of generosity, not accumulation

#### Conflict Resolution
**Flow**:
1. Member flags concern about AI behavior or community interaction
2. Appropriate mediators notified based on issue type
3. Private discussion space created for involved parties
4. Community wisdom and past resolutions suggested
5. Resolution recorded for community learning

**Support**:
- AI provides relevant community agreements
- Suggests similar past resolutions
- Offers cooling-off periods and reflection prompts

**Privacy**:
- Conflict details only visible to involved parties and mediators
- Option for anonymous conflict raising
- Right to be forgotten after resolution

**Community Process**:
- Integrates with existing community justice practices
- Focuses on relationship repair, not punishment
- Builds community resilience through conflict transformation

- **Content Priority**: Core functions accessible on smallest screens
- **Interaction Adaptation**: Swipe gestures for navigation, long-press for options
- **Performance**: Lightweight UI, minimal data transfer

## Accessibility Design

### Universal Design Principles
- **Perceivable**: High contrast, large text, audio descriptions
- **Operable**: Keyboard navigation, voice commands, gesture alternatives
- **Understandable**: Plain language, progressive disclosure, contextual help
- **Robust**: Works with screen readers, magnifiers, alternative input devices

### Specific Accommodations
- **Visual**: Screen reader support, high contrast mode, text size controls
- **Auditory**: Visual alerts, captions for audio, sign language video options
- **Motor**: Large touch targets, voice control, simplified gestures
- **Cognitive**: Consistent navigation, plain language, reduced cognitive load

### Testing Strategy
- **Community Testing**: Elders and people with disabilities as primary testers
- **Assistive Technology**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, TalkBack, VoiceOver
- **Feedback Integration**: Monthly accessibility review with community

## Data Visualization

### Community Analytics
- **Community-Controlled**: Communities decide what to visualize
- **Transparency**: Show how AI learns from community input
- **Collective Insights**: Patterns that help community, not surveillance
- **Privacy Protection**: No individual tracking, only collective patterns
