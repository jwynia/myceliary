### Key Implementation Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Model Inference Performance
**Problem**: Small models on CPU can be slow for real-time chat
**Community Impact**: Frustrating user experience could reduce adoption
**Solution Approach**: 
- Implement response streaming for perceived speed
- Use quantization (4-bit) for 4x speedup with minimal quality loss
- Cache common community queries
- Clear "thinking" indicators to set expectations
**Learning**: Community patience for thoughtful AI responses higher than expected

#### Challenge 2: Federation NAT Traversal
**Problem**: Many communities behind routers/firewalls
**Technical Impact**: Direct P2P connections fail without intervention
**Solution Approach**:
- Implement STUN/TURN for NAT traversal
- Provide community-run relay nodes as fallback
- Clear network diagnostics for troubleshooting
- Documentation for router configuration
**Learning**: Communities willing to do technical work for autonomy

#### Challenge 3: Fine-tuning Accessibility
**Problem**: Fine-tuning typically requires technical expertise
**Community Impact**: Communities can't shape AI without technical help
**Solution Approach**:
- Simple web interface for adding training examples
- Automatic dataset creation from corrections
- One-click fine-tuning with safe defaults
- Visual feedback on training progress
**Learning**: UI design more important than algorithm sophistication

#### Challenge 4: Privacy-Preserving Federation
**Problem**: Differential privacy adds noise, reducing model quality
**Resolution**: 
- Implement adaptive privacy budgets
- Allow communities to choose privacy/utility trade-off
- Visualize privacy impact on model updates
- Default to high privacy, let communities reduce if desired
**Learning**: Communities value privacy over marginal quality improvements
