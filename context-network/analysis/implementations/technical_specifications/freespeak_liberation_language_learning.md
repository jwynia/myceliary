# FreeSpeak: Liberation Language Learning System Technical Specification

## Overview
FreeSpeak is a community-owned language learning AI system designed to systematically reduce its own necessity by transitioning learners from AI-assisted learning to human conversation partners. It directly exploits capitalism's "engagement maximization trap" by measuring success through user liberation rather than platform dependency.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Opportunity:** [[cannae_ai_opportunities#2-the-engagement-maximization-trap]]
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Strategic Foundation

### Cannae Vulnerability Exploited
Which capitalist mental model trap does this exploit?
- **Mental Model**: "Success = maximum user engagement time"
- **Vulnerability**: Cannot build tools designed to be used less over time, dismisses "completion" as a valid goal, blind to liberation through reduced dependency
- **Exploitation Strategy**: We build a system whose core metric is reducing usage over time, celebrating user "graduation" to human conversation, and strengthening real-world language communities

### Community Need Addressed
What specific community need does this serve?
- **Problem Statement**: Language learning is commodified through endless subscription apps that create dependency rather than fluency
- **Current Capitalist "Solution"**: Apps like Duolingo maximize daily active users, gamify addiction, never graduate users
- **Community Alternative**: FreeSpeak teaches language skills efficiently then connects learners to conversation partners, making itself obsolete
