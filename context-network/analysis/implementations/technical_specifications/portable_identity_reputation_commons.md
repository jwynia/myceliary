# Portable Identity & Reputation Commons Technical Specification

## Overview
The Portable Identity & Reputation Commons (PIRC) is a federated, community-governed system that enables workers to own, control, and transport their professional reputation and identity across platforms without corporate intermediaries. By exploiting capitalism's rigid assumption that platforms must control user data to capture value, PIRC makes platform lock-in structurally impossible while empowering gig workers with true data sovereignty.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Opportunity:** [[cannae_ai_opportunities#5-the-platform-lock-in-strategy]]
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Strategic Foundation

### Cannae Vulnerability Exploited
Which capitalist mental model trap does this exploit?
- **Mental Model**: "Control the platform, control the value" - platforms must own user data and reputation to monetize effectively
- **Vulnerability**: Cannot adapt when users control infrastructure, dismisses portable identity/reputation as "fragmentation", blind to user agency in platform switching
- **Exploitation Strategy**: By making reputation data structurally portable and community-verified, we eliminate the fundamental lever of platform control while creating stronger trust signals than any corporate platform can provide

### Community Need Addressed
What specific community need does this serve?
- **Problem Statement**: Gig workers lose their reputation capital when switching platforms, creating artificial dependency on exploitative platforms
- **Current Capitalist "Solution"**: Platform-siloed ratings that reset to zero on competitor platforms, forcing workers to accept poor conditions
- **Community Alternative**: Worker-owned reputation that accumulates across all work contexts, verified by peer communities rather than corporate algorithms
