# Craft Augmentation AI Technical Specification

## Overview
An AI system designed to enhance human craftsmanship without replacing it, preserving the joy, meaning, and livelihood of craft work while providing tools that amplify human creativity and skill rather than automating it away.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Opportunity:** [Cannae AI Opportunities - Automation Absolutism](../../findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md#8-the-automation-absolutism)
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Strategic Foundation

### Cannae Vulnerability Exploited
**Mental Model**: "Automate everything possible"

**Vulnerability**: 
- Cannot value human judgment preservation
- Dismisses "inefficiency" of human-in-the-loop as waste
- Blind to wisdom in selective non-automation
- Cannot understand value beyond efficiency metrics

**Exploitation Strategy**: Build AI that explicitly preserves and enhances human craft, making human judgment central rather than peripheral, creating value through human-AI collaboration that automation-focused systems cannot replicate.

### Community Need Addressed
**Problem Statement**: Craftspeople need tools that help them create better work and reach audiences without losing the essence of craft - the human touch, creative decision-making, and meaningful labor.

**Current Capitalist "Solution"**: AI that seeks to automate craft production, reducing costs by eliminating skilled workers, turning craft into commodity manufacturing.

**Community Alternative**: AI that acts as an intelligent apprentice, handling tedious tasks while preserving creative control, amplifying rather than replacing human skill, and maintaining craft as meaningful work.
