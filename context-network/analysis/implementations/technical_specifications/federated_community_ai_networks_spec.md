# Federated Community AI Networks Technical Specification

## Overview
A distributed network of community-controlled AI systems that enables communities to train, deploy, and share AI models while maintaining complete control over their data and knowledge systems.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Opportunity:** [Cannae AI Opportunities - AI Centralization Orthodoxy](../../findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md#1-the-ai-centralization-orthodoxy)
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Strategic Foundation

### Cannae Vulnerability Exploited
**Mental Model**: "AI requires massive centralized compute and data"

**Vulnerability**: 
- Dismisses distributed AI approaches as "toy" solutions
- Cannot conceive of AI that improves without harvesting user data
- Blind to collaborative learning without centralization
- Cannot compete with community-specific knowledge and context

**Exploitation Strategy**: Build deliberately "unscalable" AI systems that serve specific community needs better than any centralized system could, while communities retain complete control over their data, models, and knowledge.

### Community Need Addressed
**Problem Statement**: Communities have language, knowledge, and intelligence needs that centralized AI either ignores, commodifies, or serves poorly due to lack of local context.

**Current Capitalist "Solution"**: Large language models trained on scraped data without community consent, serving generic responses that often misunderstand local context, language, and knowledge systems.

**Community Alternative**: Locally-trained AI models that understand community-specific language, knowledge, and context, with communities controlling all data, training, and model evolution while optionally sharing insights with allied communities.
