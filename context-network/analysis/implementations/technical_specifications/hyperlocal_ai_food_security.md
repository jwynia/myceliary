# Hyperlocal AI Federations for Food Security Technical Specification

## Overview
A federation of intentionally small-scale, neighborhood-specific AI systems that support community food security through garden planning, resource sharing, and local knowledge preservation while actively resisting scaling beyond meaningful community boundaries.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Opportunity:** [Cannae AI Opportunities - Scale-or-Die Mentality](../../findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md#7-the-scale-or-die-mentality)
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Strategic Foundation

### Cannae Vulnerability Exploited
**Mental Model**: "If it doesn't scale globally, it's worthless"

**Vulnerability**: 
- Cannot see value in intentionally local solutions
- Dismisses context-specific tools as "niche"
- Blind to federation of local solutions
- Cannot compete with deep local knowledge

**Exploitation Strategy**: Build deliberately unscalable AI systems that know individual gardens, specific soil conditions, and neighborhood microclimates better than any global system ever could, with federation only for sharing patterns, not homogenizing solutions.

### Community Need Addressed
**Problem Statement**: Communities need food security solutions that understand hyperlocal conditions - specific soil, unique microclimates, traditional practices, and neighborhood relationships.

**Current Capitalist "Solution"**: Generic gardening apps that give one-size-fits-all advice, ignore local conditions, and extract data about food production without returning value to communities.

**Community Alternative**: Neighborhood-bounded AI that learns from local gardeners, preserves traditional knowledge, optimizes for specific conditions, and shares patterns with other neighborhoods without losing local specificity.

  - Values biodiversity over yield maximization
  - Preserves habitat alongside food production
  - Resists monoculture in all forms
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Pollinator corridor mapping
