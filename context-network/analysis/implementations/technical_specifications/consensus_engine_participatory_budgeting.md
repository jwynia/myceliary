# ConsensusEngine: Collective Intelligence Amplifier for Participatory Budgeting

## Overview
ConsensusEngine is a community-owned AI system designed to amplify collective wisdom and facilitate democratic decision-making in participatory budgeting processes. It directly exploits capitalism's "individual productivity obsession" by measuring success through collective understanding, consensus quality, and emergent wisdom rather than individual output metrics.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Opportunity:** [[cannae_ai_opportunities#4-the-individual-productivity-obsession]]
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Strategic Foundation

### Cannae Vulnerability Exploited
Which capitalist mental model trap does this exploit?
- **Mental Model**: "AI should make individuals more productive"
- **Vulnerability**: Cannot process collective intelligence amplification, dismisses "inefficient" collaborative processes, blind to emergence from group dynamics
- **Exploitation Strategy**: We build a system that enhances group decision-making not individual output, creates tools for consensus building and collective sensemaking, detects and amplifies emergent wisdom from community deliberation

### Community Need Addressed
What specific community need does this serve?
- **Problem Statement**: Participatory budgeting is undermined by tools that focus on vote counting rather than collective wisdom, creating winner/loser dynamics instead of consensus
- **Current Capitalist "Solution"**: Voting apps that maximize individual choice expression, gamify engagement, create competitive allocation
- **Community Alternative**: ConsensusEngine facilitates deep collective sensemaking, surfaces shared values, builds genuine consensus around resource allocation
