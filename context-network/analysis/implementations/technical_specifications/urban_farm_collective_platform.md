# Urban Farm Collective Platform Technical Specification

## Overview
A coordination platform designed for urban farming collectives like The Black Radish that manage multiple scattered garden sites, CSA operations, volunteer coordination, and knowledge sharing. This specification emphasizes how AI can accelerate development of such platforms, making them accessible to groups without technical resources.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Pattern:** [AI Development Acceleration - Rapid Prototyping](../../patterns/ai_development_acceleration_patterns.md#pattern-1-rapid-prototyping-for-non-profits)
- **Stability:** Initial specification
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Based on real-world example

## Strategic Foundation

### Community Need Addressed
**Problem Statement**: Urban farming collectives need coordination tools for:
- Managing work across multiple scattered sites
- CSA share calculation and distribution
- Volunteer scheduling and communication
- Knowledge preservation about hyperlocal conditions
- Legal and administrative documentation

**Current Reality**: Groups like The Black Radish use spreadsheets, paper, and informal communication, which works but limits replication and growth.

**AI Acceleration Opportunity**: AI can rapidly prototype custom platforms that match each collective's specific workflow, dramatically lowering barriers for new groups to start.

### Anti-Capitalist Design Principles
- **Community Ownership**: Platform owned by collective, not external entity
- **Federation Ready**: Built for connection with other collectives
- **Data Sovereignty**: All data remains under collective control
- **No Surveillance**: No tracking beyond operational necessity
- **Gift Economy Integration**: Sliding scale and non-monetary exchange built in

### Technical Architecture

#### Development Approach Using AI

**Week 1: Requirements Gathering**
```
1. Document collective's current workflows
2. Identify pain points and opportunities
3. Prioritize features for MVP
4. Create user stories with collective members
```

**Week 2-3: AI-Assisted Development**
```
1. Use AI to generate initial database schema
2. Create basic CRUD interfaces for core data
3. Build mobile-responsive views
4. Implement collective's specific workflows
```

**Week 4: Testing and Iteration**
```
1. Deploy to collective for testing
2. Gather feedback on usability
3. Use AI to quickly iterate on problems
4. Add requested features
```

**Ongoing: Community Maintenance**
```
1. Train collective members on basic maintenance
2. Document customization points
3. Share base platform with commons
4. Support federation with other collectives
```

#### Technology Stack (AI-Generated Recommendation)

**For Simplicity and Accessibility:**
- **Frontend**: React or Vue.js (good AI support)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (widely known)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (robust, open source)
- **Hosting**: Digital Ocean or similar (affordable)

**Traditional Approach**: Build generic platform, customize later
**Collective-First Approach**: Build for specific collective, extract common patterns

**Benefits**:
- Matches actual workflows from day one
- Collective ownership from start
- Easier to understand and modify
- Other collectives can fork and adapt

#### Pattern: Progressive Enhancement

**Start Simple**: Basic coordination tools
**Add Features**: As collective grows and needs emerge
**Stay Focused**: Resist feature creep
**Community Driven**: Collective decides priorities

#### Pattern: Federation Readiness

**Local First**: All data stays with collective
**Standards Based**: Use common formats for data exchange
**Optional Sharing**: Collectives choose what to share
**Protocol Evolution**: Federation standards emerge from practice
