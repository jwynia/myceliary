# Careful AI Development for Elder Care Technical Specification

## Overview
A community-governed AI system for elder care that prioritizes careful, iterative development with continuous elder and caregiver participation, implementing veto powers and slow deployment cycles that build trust through demonstrated respect for community wisdom.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Technical Specification
- **Source Opportunity:** [Cannae AI Opportunities - Innovation Speed Cult](../../findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md#6-the-innovation-speed-cult)
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Strategic Foundation

### Cannae Vulnerability Exploited
**Mental Model**: "Move fast and break things"

**Vulnerability**: 
- Cannot compete with careful, community-centered design
- Dismisses "slow" iterative approaches as inefficient
- Blind to harm from rapid deployment
- Cannot value building trust through patience

**Exploitation Strategy**: Build AI systems through radically slow, careful processes where elder communities have continuous veto power, creating trust and effectiveness that rapid deployment can never achieve.

### Community Need Addressed
**Problem Statement**: Elder communities need supportive AI tools but are harmed by rapidly-deployed systems that don't understand their needs, contexts, or concerns.

**Current Capitalist "Solution"**: Quickly-deployed elder care AI that treats elders as passive recipients, optimizes for efficiency over dignity, and changes rapidly without community input.

**Community Alternative**: Elder-led AI development with mandatory slow deployment, continuous community feedback loops, and veto powers at every stage, ensuring AI serves rather than disrupts elder communities.
