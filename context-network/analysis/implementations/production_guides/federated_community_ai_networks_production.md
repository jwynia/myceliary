governance:
  model: "modified_consensus"  # consensus, majority, supermajority
  quorum: 0.6  # 60% participation required
  approval_threshold: 0.75  # 75% approval needed
  veto_enabled: true  # Any member can block harmful changes
  discussion_period: 72  # Hours for community discussion
```

**Community Policies to Establish**:
1. **AI Behavior Guidelines**
   - How formal/casual should AI communicate?
   - What topics are off-limits?
   - How should AI handle conflicts?

2. **Data Governance Policies**
   - What data can AI learn from?
   - How long is data retained?
   - Who can access community data?

3. **Federation Policies**
   - Which communities to connect with?
   - What knowledge to share?
   - How to handle federation conflicts?

**Administrative Roles**:
- **System Administrator** (2 people): Technical maintenance, updates, backups

1. **Community Networks**: Check existing mutual aid networks
2. **Values Alignment**: Ensure shared anti-capitalist values
3. **Technical Compatibility**: Verify similar governance models
4. **Trust Building**: Start with social connections first

**Federation Agreement Template**:
```markdown
# Federation Agreement between [Community A] and [Community B]

## Shared Values

- Mutual aid and solidarity
- Privacy and consent
- Democratic governance

## Knowledge Sharing
- Language translations: Yes
- Local knowledge: With attribution
- Personal data: Never
- Governance decisions: Monthly summary

- Joint troubleshooting

Signed: [Community Representatives]
Date: [Date]
```

**Technical Federation Setup**:
```bash
# Generate federation credentials
python scripts/federation_setup.py --new-partner

# Exchange with partner community (secure channel)
# Partner public key: [Paste here]
# Your public key generated: [Displayed]

# Configure connection
python scripts/add_federation_partner.py \
  --name "Neighboring Food Coop" \
  --endpoint "https://coop.community-ai.example" \
  --public-key "./keys/coop-public.key"

# Test connection
python scripts/test_federation.py --partner coop

# Success output:
# ✓ Handshake successful
# ✓ Encryption verified
# ✓ Test knowledge item shared
# ✓ Governance compatibility confirmed
```

### Resource Sharing

**Knowledge Sharing Protocol**:
```yaml
# config/federation_sharing.yml
sharing_rules:
  language_models:
    share: true
    require_attribution: true
    exclude: ["personal_conversations", "private_meetings"]
    
  community_knowledge:
    share: "with_consent"
    categories:
      public_events: "automatic"
      gardening_tips: "approved_only"
      governance_decisions: "summary_only"
      
  technical_resources:
    model_improvements: true
    security_alerts: true
    custom_code: "reviewed_only"
```

**Mutual Aid Features**:
- **Technical Support Network**: 24/7 community tech support rotation
- **Resource Alerts**: "Community B needs Spanish translator for their AI"
- **Knowledge Requests**: "Anyone have AI training data for urban farming?"
- **Celebration Sharing**: "Community C's AI learned 100 new words!"

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Technical Issues

#### Issue 1: AI Response Times Slow
**Symptoms**: Responses take >15 seconds, users frustrated
**Causes**: 
- Too many concurrent users
- Model needs optimization
- Memory leak in long-running process
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check system resources
htop  # Look for CPU/memory usage

# Check active connections
python scripts/show_active_users.py

# Review response time logs
tail -n 100 logs/response_times.log | grep SLOW
```
**Resolution**:
1. Restart AI service: `sudo systemctl restart community-ai`
2. Clear model cache: `python scripts/clear_cache.py`
3. If persistent, implement rate limiting
**Prevention**: Daily automated restarts, monitoring alerts

#### Issue 2: Federation Connection Lost
**Symptoms**: No updates from partner, sync errors
**Causes**:
- Network issues
- Certificate expiration
- Partner system maintenance
**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Test network connectivity
ping partner.community-ai.example

# Check certificate validity
openssl s_client -connect partner.example:9000 < /dev/null

# Review federation logs
grep ERROR logs/federation.log | tail -20
```
**Resolution**:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify certificates current
3. Contact partner community
4. Re-initialize connection if needed
**Prevention**: Automated certificate renewal, partner status page

#### Issue 3: User Cannot Log In
**Symptoms**: Valid credentials rejected
**Causes**:
- Account locked after failed attempts
- Session database full
- Cookie problems
**Resolution**:
1. Check account status: `python scripts/user_status.py --email user@example`
2. Clear sessions if needed: `python scripts/clear_old_sessions.py`
3. Have user clear browser cookies
4. Reset password if necessary
**Prevention**: Session cleanup cron job, clear error messages

### Emergency Procedures

#### Security Breach Response

1. **Immediate Response** (First 15 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Isolate system
   sudo systemctl stop community-ai
   sudo ufw deny 8080
   sudo ufw deny 9000
   
   # Notify community
   python scripts/emergency_notification.py --type security
   
   # Preserve evidence
   sudo tar -czf /backup/incident-$(date +%s).tar.gz /var/log/
   ```

2. **Investigation** (First 2 hours):
   - Review access logs for suspicious activity
   - Check for unauthorized data access
   - Identify potential impact scope
   - Document everything found

3. **Recovery** (Day 1):
   - Restore from clean backup if needed
   - Apply security patches
   - Reset all credentials
   - Strengthen vulnerable points

4. **Community Healing** (Week 1):
   - Full transparency about what happened
   - Support affected members
   - Discuss lessons learned
   - Update security practices

#### System Failure Recovery

**Total System Failure**:
1. **Boot from recovery USB**
2. **Run diagnostics**: `./recovery/diagnose.sh`
3. **Restore from backup**: `./recovery/restore_full.sh`
4. **Verify community data**: `./recovery/verify_data.sh`
5. **Community notification**: Via phone tree if system down

**Partial Failure** (e.g., AI model corrupted):
```bash
# Identify problem component
./scripts/component_health.sh

# Restore specific component
./scripts/restore_component.sh --component ai_model

# Verify functionality
./scripts/test_component.sh --component ai_model

# Resume operations
sudo systemctl start community-ai
```

## Community Evolution and Growth

### Scaling Considerations

**Adding More Members**:
- At 75% capacity, plan hardware upgrade
- Implement user onboarding cohorts
- Create mentor program for new members
- Document growing pains for others

**Hardware Scaling Path**:
- Phase 1 (0-50 users): Single server
- Phase 2 (50-200 users): Add RAM and storage
- Phase 3 (200-500 users): Second server for redundancy
- Phase 4 (500+ users): Distributed architecture

**Governance Scaling**:
- Small (< 50): Direct democracy feasible
- Medium (50-200): Working groups recommended
- Large (200+): Delegate system may be needed
- Always: Maintain community veto power

### Long-term Sustainability

#### Technical Sustainability

**Knowledge Transfer Plan**:
1. **Documentation**: Keep all procedures current
2. **Cross-training**: Minimum 2 people per role
3. **Apprenticeship**: New techs shadow experienced
4. **External support**: Partner community backup

**System Evolution**:
- Quarterly community review of needs
- Annual major version planning
- Continuous small improvements
- Community-driven roadmap

#### Community Sustainability

**Leadership Rotation**:
- 6-month terms for key roles
- Overlap periods for knowledge transfer
- Recognition for service
- Prevent burnout through sharing

**New Member Integration**:
- Monthly orientation sessions
- Buddy system for first 3 months
- Gradual introduction to governance
- Celebrate first contributions

**Financial Sustainability**:
```
Monthly Budget Example:
- Electricity: $30
- Internet: $50
- Hardware fund: $40
- Training fund: $20
- Emergency fund: $10
Total: $150/month

Funding Sources:
- Member contributions (sliding scale)
- Community fundraisers
- Grants (no strings attached)
- Service exchange with other communities
```
