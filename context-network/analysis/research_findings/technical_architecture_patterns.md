# Technical Architecture Patterns for Community-Controlled Systems

## Executive Summary

This research examines decentralized and federated technical architectures that enable true community control over digital infrastructure. Key protocols analyzed include ActivityPub (powering Mastodon), Matrix (secure communications), IPFS (distributed storage), blockchain-based alternatives (Lens Protocol, DeSo), and privacy-preserving technologies. These architectures share common patterns: no single point of control, data sovereignty for users/communities, interoperability through open standards, and resistance to censorship and corporate capture.

## Key Architectural Patterns
