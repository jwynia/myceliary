# Alternative Measurement and Evaluation Systems for Community Technology

## Executive Summary

Traditional KPIs fail to capture the transformative potential of community technology. Alternative frameworks including liberation metrics, solidarity indicators, commons health assessments, and participatory evaluation methods provide holistic approaches that measure what matters: community empowerment, collective wellbeing, democratic participation, and sustainable resource management. These frameworks shift from extractive metrics (users, engagement, revenue) to regenerative indicators (liberation, solidarity, commons vitality).

## Foundational Principles

### Beyond Capitalist Metrics
Traditional technology metrics optimize for:
- User growth and retention
- Engagement and screen time
- Revenue and profitability
- Market share and competition
- Individual productivity

Community technology requires metrics that value:
- Collective liberation and autonomy
- Solidarity and mutual support
- Commons health and sustainability
- Democratic participation
- Community resilience

### Participatory Definition of Success
Communities themselves must define what success looks like rather than accepting imposed metrics. This requires:
- Collective visioning processes
- Cultural relevance in indicators
- Multiple ways of knowing/measuring
- Ongoing refinement based on experience
- Rejection of universal standards

## Conclusion

Measuring what matters requires fundamentally different approaches than capitalist metrics. Liberation, solidarity, commons health, and community wellbeing demand participatory methods that honor multiple ways of knowing. Success means communities gaining power, not platforms gaining users. These alternative frameworks provide practical approaches for documenting transformation while resisting extraction. As movements grow, shared measurement approaches enable collective learning while respecting local autonomy. The revolution will not be KPI'd - but it will be evaluated by those living it.
