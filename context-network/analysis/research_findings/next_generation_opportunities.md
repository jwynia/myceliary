## Conclusion

The next wave of technological change presents both threats and opportunities. By identifying emerging technologies early and building community alternatives before corporate capture completes, we can ensure these powerful tools serve liberation rather than extraction. Success requires vigilance in monitoring emerging fields, speed in organizing responses, and commitment to building alternatives even when corporate dominance seems inevitable. The windows are open but closing - communities must act now to claim technological futures that serve collective flourishing rather than private accumulation. Every technology that escapes capture creates precedent and power for liberating the next.
