# Cannae Research Progress Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the strategic research conducted to expand the Cannae approach - exploiting capitalist blind spots with community-controlled alternatives. We've completed 10 major research areas providing actionable intelligence for movement building.

## Completed Research

### 1. ✅ Competitive Intelligence: Capitalist AI Blind Spots

**Proven Strategies:**
- Start where corporations see no profit
- Build strong local relationships first
- Use regulatory advocacy strategically
- Design for federation from beginning

### 3. ✅ Emerging Technology Gaps Analysis
**Opportunities Found:**

### 5. ✅ Policy and Regulatory Landscape
**Key Developments:**
- Federal preemption defeated - local control preserved
- States actively legislating AI governance
- Patchwork creating both challenges and opportunities
- Community participation windows opening

**Strategic Openings:**
- Local regulations can favor community approaches
- State experimentation creating precedents
- Federal frameworks still forming

### 6. ✅ Progressive Communication Strategies
**Effective Approaches:**
- Values-based messaging beats facts alone
- Public narrative structure (Self/Us/Now)
- Frame alignment for movement building
- Whole-worker organizing (AEIOU)
- Embodied rhetoric for impact

**Key Insight:** Technical solutions need narrative infrastructure

### 7. ✅ Implementation Case Studies
**Successful Models Analyzed:**
- **Guifi.net**: 35,000+ node mesh network
- **Stocksy United**: $10M revenue photographer co-op
- **Rhizomatica**: Community cellular in rural Mexico
- **Resonate**: Stream-to-own music platform

**Common Success Factors:**
- Community need clearly defined
- Governance before technology
- Start small, prove model
- Regulatory engagement early
- Federation for scaling

### 8. ✅ Funding and Resource Models
**Non-Extractive Options:**
- Solidarity economy funds
- Community loan funds (Seed Commons model)
- Participatory budgeting
- Cooperative ownership structures
- Prepayment and timebanking

**Key Principles:**
- Patient capital aligned with values
- Democratic control of resources
- Reinvestment vs extraction
- Multiple revenue streams

### 9. ✅ Technical Architecture Patterns
**Proven Architectures:**
- **Federation**: ActivityPub, Matrix
- **P2P**: Nostr, Secure Scuttlebutt  
- **Blockchain**: Lens Protocol, DeSo
- **Storage**: IPFS content addressing
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge, federated learning

**Selection Criteria:**
- Match architecture to community needs
- Prioritize data sovereignty
- Design for resilience
- Enable exit rights

### 10. ✅ Opposition Research and Counter-Strategies
**Corporate Attacks:**
- Platform lock-in mechanisms
- Regulatory capture tactics
- Embrace-extend-extinguish
- Community division strategies
- Legal/economic warfare

**Defense Strategies:**
- Strong coalition building
- Transparency initiatives
- Protective governance structures
- Counter-narrative development
- Technical resilience
