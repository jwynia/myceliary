# Non-Extractive Funding Models for Community Technology

## Executive Summary

Community technology projects can access funding through solidarity economy funds, community loan funds, participatory budgeting, and other alternatives to venture capital. These models prioritize collective ownership, democratic decision-making, and social impact over profit extraction.

## Key Funding Models

### 1. Solidarity Economy Funds

**Characteristics:**
- Focus on cooperation and mutual aid over competition
- Revenue reinvested in ecosystem rather than extracted as profit
- Democratic governance structures
- Support for interconnected networks of projects

**Examples:**
- **Open Collective Foundation**: Provides legal, financial, and technical infrastructure for tech collectives
- **Community Land Trusts**: Preserve community control over resources
- **Worker Cooperatives**: Share ownership and profits among workers
- **Complementary Currencies**: Keep value circulating locally

### 2. Community Loan Funds & Non-Extractive Lending

**Seed Commons Model:**
- Network of community-controlled loan funds
- Loans only repaid when project becomes profitable
- Cooperative governance with local control
- Technical assistance provided alongside funding
- Focus on equity, accountability, and collective ownership

**Our Power Loan Fund (Climate Justice Alliance):**
- Channels divested money into local loan funds
- Supports just transition and community-led tech
- Centers sustainability and local self-determination
- Non-extractive finance principles throughout

**Key Features of Non-Extractive Lending:**
- No repayments until profitability achieved
- Interest rates cover costs, not wealth extraction
- Affected stakeholders involved in decisions
- Patient capital with long-term view

### 3. Participatory Budgeting

**Implementation:**
- Communities directly decide resource allocation
- Democratizes investment at grassroots level
- Can be municipal, organizational, or network-based
- Transparent process with community oversight

**Benefits for Tech Projects:**
- Direct community input on technology needs
- Builds buy-in and ownership from start
- Ensures alignment with community priorities
- Creates accountability mechanisms

## Implementation Strategies

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
1. **Map funding needs:** Initial capital, operating costs, growth projections
2. **Identify values alignment:** Which models match project principles?
3. **Assess community assets:** What resources exist locally?
4. **Build relationships:** Connect with aligned funders early

### Phase 2: Structure Development
1. **Legal entity formation:** Choose structure supporting chosen model
2. **Governance design:** Embed democratic decision-making
3. **Financial systems:** Transparent accounting and reporting
4. **Accountability mechanisms:** Community oversight processes

### Phase 3: Resource Mobilization
1. **Diversify sources:** Don't rely on single funding stream
2. **Build incrementally:** Start small, prove model, then scale
3. **Document impact:** Track social returns, not just financial
4. **Share learnings:** Strengthen ecosystem through transparency

### Phase 4: Sustainability Planning
1. **Revenue generation:** Develop earned income strategies
2. **Cost optimization:** Share resources with allied projects
3. **Reserve building:** Plan for contingencies and growth
4. **Succession planning:** Ensure continuity beyond founders
