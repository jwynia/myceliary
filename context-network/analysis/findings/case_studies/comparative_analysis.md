### Overview
This analysis examines three significant historical examples of anti-capitalist technology implementation: Chile's Project Cybersyn, Zapatista autonomous networks, and Black Panthers survival programs. Despite their different contexts and approaches, these cases reveal important patterns in how technology can support community autonomy and systemic change.

### Cross-Case Comparison

#### Scale and Scope
| Case Study | Scale | Primary Focus | Time Period |
|------------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Project Cybersyn | National | Economic Management | 1971-1973 |
| Zapatista Networks | Regional | Community Autonomy | 1994-Present |
| Black Panthers Programs | Local/National | Community Survival | 1966-1982 |

#### Technology Approaches

1. **Infrastructure Models**
   - **Cybersyn**: Centralized, state-supported infrastructure
   - **Zapatistas**: Decentralized, community-controlled networks
   - **Black Panthers**: Distributed, chapter-based systems

2. **Communication Systems**
   - **Cybersyn**: Real-time telex network
   - **Zapatistas**: Hybrid digital-physical networks
   - **Black Panthers**: Face-to-face and print media

3. **Decision-Making Tools**
   - **Cybersyn**: Computerized modeling and operations room
   - **Zapatistas**: Assembly-based collective processes
   - **Black Panthers**: Distributed chapter leadership

### Common Patterns

#### Organizational Principles
1. **Democratic Control**
   - All cases prioritized community/worker involvement
   - Different mechanisms for collective decision-making
   - Balance between coordination and autonomy

2. **Resilient Structures**
   - Distributed responsibility
   - Redundant systems
   - Adaptable frameworks
   - Security-conscious design

3. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Local expertise valued
   - Political education embedded
   - Practical skills development
   - Collective learning processes

#### Implementation Strategies

1. **Resource Management**
   - Work within material constraints
   - Creative use of available technology
   - Focus on sustainability
   - Community resource pooling

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Protection against disruption
   - Information security measures
   - Physical security integration
   - Resilient communication methods

3. **Community Integration**
   - Local needs prioritization
   - Cultural appropriateness
   - Accessibility focus
   - Collective ownership

### Key Differences

#### Centralization vs. Decentralization
- Cybersyn: Centralized coordination with distributed input
- Zapatistas: Decentralized networks with federation
- Black Panthers: Hybrid model with autonomous chapters

#### Technology Sophistication
- Cybersyn: Advanced for its time
- Zapatistas: Appropriate technology focus
- Black Panthers: Basic technology emphasis

#### Political Context
- Cybersyn: State power with external threats
- Zapatistas: Autonomous zones under pressure
- Black Panthers: Community organizing under repression

### Synthesis of Lessons
