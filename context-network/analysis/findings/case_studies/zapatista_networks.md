### Overview
The Zapatista movement in Chiapas, Mexico, has developed a distinctive approach to technology that prioritizes community autonomy, collective decision-making, and technological sovereignty. Their networks demonstrate how marginalized communities can maintain independence while leveraging technology for self-governance.

### Key Components

#### Network Infrastructure
1. **Physical Layer**
   - Rural, indigenous communities with limited infrastructure
   - Often lacking basic electricity/telephone services
   - Reliance on intermediary support networks
   - Physical document transfer systems

2. **Communication Systems**
   - Trusted intermediary networks
   - Digital-to-physical conversion points
   - Multi-language translation processes
   - Collective information sharing methods

3. **Support Organizations**
   - La Neta (internet access facilitation)
   - Global mailing lists (e.g., Mexico 2000)
   - Activist support networks
   - Technical solidarity groups

#### Organizational Structure
1. **Governance Levels**
   - Local Autonomous Governments (GAL)
   - Regional Collectives (CGAZ)
   - Federated decision-making bodies
   - Base community assemblies

2. **Decision Processes**
   - Horizontal governance structures
   - Collective technology decisions
   - Multi-language deliberation
   - Inclusive participation methods

### Implementation Approach

#### Core Strategies
1. **Creative Adaptation**
   - Working within infrastructure limitations
   - Hybrid digital-physical systems
   - Language-appropriate solutions
   - Accessibility-focused design

2. **Community Control**
   - Base-level decision-making
   - Collective verification processes
   - Democratic technology governance
   - Sovereignty-preserving choices

#### Key Practices
1. **Information Flow**
   - Physical-to-digital conversion
   - Multi-directional communication
   - Cross-community sharing
   - Rapid verification systems

2. **Access Methods**
   - Printed materials distribution
   - Verbal information sharing
   - Translation services
   - Collective discussion forums

### Anti-Capitalist Analysis

#### Strengths
1. **Autonomy Protection**
   - Independent infrastructure
   - Community-controlled systems
   - External dependency reduction
   - Sovereignty preservation

2. **Democratic Control**
   - Collective decision-making
   - Inclusive participation
   - Horizontal organization
   - Base community power

#### Lessons for Current Projects

1. **Infrastructure Design**
   - Decentralized architectures
   - Hybrid system approaches
   - Accessibility prioritization
   - Sovereignty-preserving choices

2. **Governance Models**
   - Community-based control
   - Multi-level coordination
   - Inclusive decision-making
   - Democratic verification

3. **Implementation Strategies**
   - Work within constraints
   - Build support networks
   - Ensure broad participation
   - Maintain independence

4. **Sustainability Factors**
   - Community ownership
   - Skills distribution
   - Resource independence
   - Network resilience
