### Overview
Mesh networking projects represent a decentralized approach to communication infrastructure where communities build and control their own networks. These initiatives demonstrate how non-hierarchical technology architectures can support both disaster resilience and ongoing technological sovereignty.

### Key Components

#### Technical Infrastructure
1. **Network Architecture**
   - Decentralized node structure
   - Peer-to-peer connectivity
   - Redundant pathways
   - Non-hierarchical design

2. **Hardware Systems**
   - Off-the-shelf Wi-Fi routers
   - Mesh-enabled devices
   - Mobile relay units
   - Emergency deployments

3. **Implementation Models**
   - Community-led networks
   - Disaster response systems
   - Hybrid approaches
   - Temporary installations
