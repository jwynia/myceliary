# Ink & Switch and Myceliary Project Parallels
*Created: 2025-06-27*

## Overview
This analysis examines the parallels between Ink & Switch's independent research lab model and the myceliary project's approach to developing anti-capitalist AI frameworks.

## Core Philosophical Alignment

### 1. Knowledge as Commons
**Ink & Switch:**
- Publishes all research freely online
- Open sources key projects (Automerge)
- Educational mission central to work

**Myceliary:**
- Context network as open knowledge base
- Anti-capitalist framework freely available
- Documentation-first approach

**Parallel:** Both treat knowledge as public good rather than proprietary asset

### 2. Human-Centered Technology
**Ink & Switch:**
- "Tools that respect humanity"
- User sovereignty over data (local-first)
- Malleable software for user customization

**Myceliary:**
- Technology serving human needs not profit
- Community benefit over efficiency
- Democratized access to AI tools

**Parallel:** Both prioritize human agency over algorithmic control

### 3. Resistance to Platform Capitalism
**Ink & Switch:**
- Local-first counters cloud monopolies
- User data ownership fundamental
- Decentralized collaboration tools

**Myceliary:**
- Anti-capitalist framework explicitly
- Identifying capitalist traps in tech
- Alternative to surveillance capitalism

**Parallel:** Both actively resist dominant platform monopoly models

## Operational Approaches

### 1. Research-First Methodology
**Ink & Switch:**
- Multi-year investigations
- Building to understand
- Theory through practice

**Myceliary:**
- Deep framework development
- Case study analysis
- Pattern identification

**Parallel:** Both prioritize understanding over rapid deployment

### 2. Small Team Model
**Ink & Switch:**
- 8-15 person team
- Interdisciplinary mix
- Project autonomy

**Myceliary:**
- Currently individual/small team
- Could adopt similar structure
- Focus enables depth

**Parallel:** Small teams enable mission focus over bureaucracy

### 3. Network Building
**Ink & Switch:**
- Alumni at Muse, other projects
- Conference presentations
- Open source community

**Myceliary:**
- Building practitioner network
- Documentation for replication
- Framework adoption goal

**Parallel:** Both seek ecosystem impact beyond direct work

## Funding Model Lessons

### What Myceliary Could Adopt:
1. **Mixed Revenue Streams**
   - Workshop/education offerings
   - Consulting on framework application
   - Membership/community support

2. **Values-Aligned Funders**
   - Identify philanthropists sharing anti-capitalist values
   - Foundation grants for alternative economics
   - Crowdfunding from beneficiary communities

3. **Spin-off Sustainability**
   - Tools built using framework
   - Implementation partnerships
   - Training/certification programs

### Key Differences:
- Ink & Switch builds tools; myceliary builds frameworks
- Ink & Switch has corporate sponsors; myceliary may want to avoid
- Ink & Switch focuses on technical; myceliary on social/political

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Adopt Lab Structure
- Formalize as independent research entity
- Recruit 3-5 aligned researchers
- Establish clear mission statement
- Create governance structure

### 2. Develop Demonstration Projects
- Build example applications using framework
- Show concrete benefits of approach
- Create adoption templates
- Document implementation patterns

### 3. Cultivate Funding Ecosystem
- Map potential aligned funders
- Develop workshop curriculum
- Create membership/support tiers
- Explore cooperative ownership models

### 4. Network Amplification
- Connect with similar initiatives
- Regular publication schedule
- Conference/event presence
- Online community building

## Unique Myceliary Opportunities

### 1. Explicitly Political Stance
Unlike Ink & Switch's implicit politics, myceliary can:
- Directly critique capitalism
- Build solidarity networks
- Support movement organizing
- Create revolutionary tools

### 2. Global South Focus
Myceliary could prioritize:
- Decolonial technology approaches
- Global South partnerships
- Non-Western knowledge systems
- Alternative development models

### 3. Cooperative Integration
Beyond independent lab:
- Worker cooperative structure
- Platform cooperative tools
- Federated governance models
- Commons-based peer production

### 4. Movement Infrastructure
Build tools for:
- Mutual aid coordination
- Community organizing
- Alternative economies
- Solidarity networks

## Implementation Pathway

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)
- Formalize organizational structure
- Develop funding strategy
- Launch initial workshops
- Build core team

### Phase 2: Demonstration (Months 7-12)
- Create example projects
- Publish regular research
- Establish partnerships
- Grow community

### Phase 3: Scaling (Year 2+)
- Expand team to 8-10
- Diversify funding sources
- Launch major initiatives
- Measure ecosystem impact

## Conclusion

Ink & Switch provides a proven model for independent research labs creating human-centered technology outside corporate constraints. Myceliary can adopt key elements—mixed funding, small teams, open knowledge—while maintaining its explicitly anti-capitalist stance. The combination of Ink & Switch's operational excellence with myceliary's revolutionary politics could create a powerful force for technological alternatives to capitalism.

The "independent research lab" model offers the structural independence needed to pursue long-term, values-driven research while building sustainable operations. By learning from Ink & Switch while maintaining its unique mission, myceliary can contribute to building the knowledge infrastructure for post-capitalist futures.
