# Technical Specifications Index

## Overview

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for systems that implement the anti-capitalist AI opportunities identified through the Cannae framework and other analyses.

## Specifications

### 1. Medical AI Data Dignity Cooperative
**File**: [[medical_ai_data_dignity_cooperative_spec]]
**Exploits**: Data Monetization Imperative
**Summary**: Comprehensive specification for a patient-owned medical AI cooperative where communities collectively own their health intelligence and value flows back to data creators rather than platform owners.

**Key Features**:
- Privacy-preserving collective intelligence using federated learning
- Democratic governance with one-member-one-vote
- Value distribution mechanisms benefiting patients
- Federation protocol for inter-cooperative collaboration
- Anti-extraction safeguards against corporate capture

## Specification Template

All specifications in this directory follow a standard template:

1. **Strategic Foundation**: How it exploits capitalist vulnerabilities
2. **System Architecture**: Technical design and components
3. **Technical Requirements**: Detailed implementation needs
4. **Community Governance Integration**: Democratic control mechanisms
5. **Implementation Phases**: Staged rollout plan
6. **Resource Requirements**: Human, technical, and financial needs
7. **Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigations
8. **Success Metrics**: How we measure impact beyond profit

## Creating New Specifications

When adding specifications:
1. Use the template structure above
2. Clearly identify which capitalist vulnerability is being exploited
3. Emphasize community ownership and democratic governance
4. Include anti-extraction mechanisms
5. Define success in human rather than profit terms
6. Update this index with a summary and connections
