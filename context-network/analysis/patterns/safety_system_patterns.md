### Pattern Overview

These patterns represent reusable design solutions for safety challenges in community platforms. Each pattern addresses specific safety concerns while considering potential unintended consequences. They are intended to be adaptable to different community contexts and technical implementations.

### Core Safety Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Progressive Trust Model

**Problem:** How to balance safety with privacy when users first connect on a platform.

**Solution:** Implement a staged disclosure system where information visibility increases as trust develops through positive interactions.

**Implementation:**
- Initial connections reveal minimal personal information
- After mutual positive interactions, additional profile details become visible
- Full profile access only after established trust threshold
- User-controlled acceleration or deceleration of information disclosure

**Examples:**
- Dating platforms that reveal location proximity only after mutual interest
- Marketplace platforms that share detailed contact information only after transaction agreement
- Community forums with progressive permissions based on engagement history

**Considerations:**
- Users must maintain control over disclosure progression
- Clear indicators of current disclosure level
- Emergency "reset" option to revoke access if trust is broken

#### Pattern 2: Contextual Identity Management

**Problem:** Users need different identity presentations in different contexts, but fragmented identities can undermine reputation systems.

**Solution:** Support multiple connected identity facets that allow different presentations while maintaining reputation linkages.

**Implementation:**
- Core verified identity linked to multiple public personas
- Contextual controls for information visibility
- Reputation system that aggregates across contexts while respecting boundaries
- Clear user interfaces for managing active context

**Examples:**
- Professional networking sites with separate personal/professional views
- Community platforms with topic-specific profiles linked to core identity
- Multi-role systems where users can be both service providers and clients

**Considerations:**
- Prevent correlation attacks that could link separate contexts
- Maintain consistent reputation signals across contexts
- Provide clear context switching interfaces
- Allow reputation portability while preserving context boundaries

#### Pattern 3: Decentralized Reputation Networks

**Problem:** Centralized reputation systems create single points of failure and don't reflect community-specific trust values.

**Solution:** Implement community-specific reputation metrics that can be selectively shared across community boundaries.

**Implementation:**
- Local reputation scoring within community groups
- Cryptographic verification of reputation claims
- Selective disclosure of reputation across communities
- Community-controlled reputation metrics and thresholds

**Examples:**
- P2P marketplace with community-endorsed badges
- Resource sharing networks with trust circles
- Interest groups with internal recognition systems

**Considerations:**
- Prevent sybil attacks through identity verification
- Balance transparency with privacy
- Support reputation recovery mechanisms
- Allow communities to define their own trust metrics

### Safety Mechanism Patterns

#### Pattern 4: Trusted Contact Check-in

**Problem:** Users need safety verification when meeting unknown contacts while maintaining privacy.

**Solution:** Time-bound safety check-in system with trusted contacts and escalation protocols.

**Implementation:**
- User schedules meeting with time parameters
- System notifies trusted contacts of pending meeting
- Automatic check-in prompts at designated times
- Missed check-ins trigger escalation to trusted contacts
- Optional location sharing only activated if check-in is missed

**Examples:**
- Dating apps with friend safety features
- Rideshare services with trusted contact monitoring
- Marketplace platforms with meeting safety systems

**Considerations:**
- Minimize location data collection when not needed
- Ensure trusted contacts are verified
- Provide clear escalation protocols
- Allow quick activation and deactivation

#### Pattern 5: Graduated Warning System

**Problem:** Binary blocking is insufficient for nuanced safety concerns, but unverified accusations create fairness issues.

**Solution:** Multi-level warning system with progressive visibility and verification requirements.

**Implementation:**
- Personal notes visible only to the writer
- Community patterns visible based on aggregated anonymous reports
- Verified warnings with higher visibility require stronger evidence
- Context-specific warnings that apply only in relevant situations

**Examples:**
- Dating platforms with personal note features
- Service marketplaces with reliability metrics
- Community forums with moderation transparency

**Considerations:**
- Clear policies to prevent weaponization
- Appeals and restoration processes
- Evidence requirements that increase with warning severity
- Transparency about warning mechanisms

#### Pattern 6: Conditional Identity Verification

**Problem:** Identity verification enhances safety but can exclude vulnerable users or create privacy risks.

**Solution:** Context-dependent verification with multiple acceptable methods and privacy controls.

**Implementation:**
- Multiple verification methods with different privacy implications
- Contextual verification requirements based on activity risk
- Verification attestations without storing sensitive documents
- Community vouching as supplementary verification method

**Examples:**
- Verification through existing trusted relationships
- Activity-based progressive verification requirements
- Cryptographic attestation without central storage

**Considerations:**
- Support verification methods accessible to undocumented users
- Minimize retention of sensitive verification documents
- Provide clear control over verification visibility
- Support verification without government documentation

### Infrastructure Patterns

#### Pattern 7: Zero-Knowledge Safety Proofs

**Problem:** Safety features often require sensitive data that creates security risks if centralized.

**Solution:** Cryptographic proofs that verify safety requirements without exposing underlying data.

**Implementation:**
- Zero-knowledge proofs of identity verification
- Cryptographic attestation of safety checks
- Decentralized storage of sensitive information
- Threshold encryption for emergency access

**Examples:**
- Age verification without revealing birthdate
- Background check verification without storing results
- Location proximity verification without exact locations

**Considerations:**
- Technical complexity and user understanding
- Balancing cryptographic strength with usability
- Emergency access mechanisms
- Appropriate key management

#### Pattern 8: Safety Data Firewall

**Problem:** Safety systems collect sensitive data that could be exploited if compromised.

**Solution:** Architecture that separates safety data from operational data with strong access controls.

**Implementation:**
- Separate storage for safety-critical information
- Purpose-limited access controls
- Automatic purging of temporary safety data
- Audit trails for all safety data access

**Examples:**
- Location data only activated during safety incidents
- Message content scanning that preserves privacy
- Temporary data collection during high-risk activities

**Considerations:**
- Clear data minimization policies
- User transparency about data collection
- Strong technical and policy firewalls
- Regular security audits

## Pattern Application Guidelines

When applying these patterns, consider:

1. **Context Sensitivity**: Adapt patterns to specific community needs and technical constraints
2. **Combination Approach**: Use multiple complementary patterns rather than relying on a single solution
3. **User Agency**: Maximize user control over safety mechanisms
4. **Threat Modeling**: Assess both safety risks and security/privacy risks
5. **Continuous Evaluation**: Monitor for unintended consequences and adaptation by bad actors
