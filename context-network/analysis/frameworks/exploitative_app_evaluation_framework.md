# Framework for Evaluating Exploitative Apps and Community Alternative Potential

## Purpose

This framework provides systematic criteria for identifying commercial applications with exploitative business models and assessing the viability of community-driven alternatives.

## Exploitation Assessment Criteria

### 1. Data Extraction (0-10 scale)
- **Personal Data Harvesting**: How much personal information is collected?
- **Behavioral Tracking**: Extent of user activity monitoring
- **Third-Party Sharing**: Data sold or shared with advertisers
- **Consent Clarity**: How clearly users understand data use
- **Deletion Difficulty**: Barriers to removing personal data

### 2. Economic Extraction (0-10 scale)
- **Platform Fees**: Percentage taken from transactions
- **Hidden Costs**: Fees not apparent upfront
- **Wage Suppression**: For gig economy apps
- **Monopolistic Pricing**: Lack of alternatives drives up costs
- **Wealth Transfer**: Money flowing from communities to corporations

### 3. Algorithmic Manipulation (0-10 scale)
- **Attention Hijacking**: Features designed for addiction
- **FOMO Engineering**: Creating artificial urgency
- **Dark Patterns**: Deceptive UI/UX practices
- **Preference Manipulation**: Steering users to profitable choices
- **Social Pressure**: Exploiting social dynamics

### 4. Lock-in Mechanisms (0-10 scale)
- **Data Portability**: Difficulty exporting user data
- **Network Effects**: Value tied to other users on platform
- **Switching Costs**: Time/money/effort to leave
- **API Restrictions**: Preventing interoperability
- **Proprietary Formats**: Non-standard data storage

### 5. Community Harm (0-10 scale)
- **Local Business Impact**: Displacing community enterprises
- **Social Fragmentation**: Breaking community bonds
- **Cultural Homogenization**: Erasing local culture
- **Environmental Damage**: Carbon footprint, waste
- **Mental Health Impact**: Anxiety, depression, isolation

## Community Alternative Viability Assessment

### Technical Feasibility (0-10 scale, higher is better)
- **Complexity**: How difficult to build core features?
- **Infrastructure Needs**: Server, bandwidth requirements
- **Maintenance Burden**: Ongoing technical work needed
- **Security Requirements**: Complexity of keeping users safe
- **Scalability**: Ability to grow with user base

### Community Readiness (0-10 scale, higher is better)
- **Technical Skills**: Available technical expertise
- **Organizing Capacity**: Ability to coordinate users
- **Financial Resources**: Funding for development/hosting
- **Time Availability**: Volunteer hours available
- **Existing Networks**: Pre-existing community bonds

### Sustainability Factors (0-10 scale, higher is better)
- **Revenue Potential**: Ethical monetization options
- **Cost Structure**: Ongoing operational expenses
- **Volunteer Burnout Risk**: Workload distribution
- **Governance Clarity**: Decision-making processes
- **Growth Strategy**: Path to reaching critical mass

### Impact Potential (0-10 scale, higher is better)
- **User Liberation**: People freed from exploitation
- **Wealth Retention**: Money staying in community
- **Data Sovereignty**: Users controlling their data
- **Skill Building**: Community learning opportunities
- **Model Replication**: Inspiring other communities

## Priority Matrix

Plot apps on two axes:
- **X-axis**: Exploitation Score (sum of exploitation criteria)
- **Y-axis**: Viability Score (sum of viability criteria)

### Quadrants:
1. **High Priority** (High Exploitation, High Viability)
   - Focus immediate efforts here
   - Examples: Food delivery, ride sharing

2. **Strategic Opportunities** (High Exploitation, Medium Viability)
   - Worth investment to improve viability
   - Examples: Social media, messaging

3. **Quick Wins** (Medium Exploitation, High Viability)
   - Easy to implement, moderate impact
   - Examples: Calendaring, note-taking

4. **Long-term Goals** (High Exploitation, Low Viability)
   - Important but need enabling conditions
   - Examples: Search engines, cloud infrastructure

## Application Categories Analysis

**Examples**: Netflix, Spotify, YouTube
- **Exploitation Score**: 30/50 (Medium-High)
- **Viability Score**: 20/50 (Low-Medium)
- **Priority**: COMMUNITY SPECIFIC

## Implementation Patterns by App Type

### Pattern 1: Platform Cooperatives (Gig Economy)
- Replace corporate platform with worker-owned
- Minimal viable features: matching, payments, ratings
- Progressive enhancement possible

### Pattern 2: Federated Networks (Social Media)
- Multiple interconnected community instances
- Each community controls its node
- Shared protocols enable communication

### Pattern 3: Local-First Apps (Productivity)
- Data lives on user devices
- Sync when connected
- No central server dependency

### Pattern 4: Data Trusts (Health/Wellness)
- Community owns aggregate data
- Individual privacy preserved
- Collective bargaining with researchers

### Pattern 5: Commons-Based (Knowledge/Education)
- Shared resource pool
- Peer production model
- Gift economy dynamics
