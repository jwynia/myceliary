# Framework for Identifying Anti-Capitalist AI Applications

## Purpose
This node provides a systematic framework for identifying AI and LLM applications that operate outside capitalist incentive structures or actively undermine them. It offers inquiry methods to discover opportunities where AI could serve human needs that profit-driven systems ignore, exploit, or actively harm.

### Inquiry Methodology

#### Primary Questions

**1. Structural Analysis**
- What human needs are currently unmet because they're unprofitable to address?
- Where do profit motives actively harm community wellbeing?
- What work is essential but economically invisible or undervalued?

**2. Power Dynamics**
- How could AI redistribute decision-making power rather than concentrate it?
- What information asymmetries could be eliminated to benefit communities?
- Where are people currently dependent on extractive systems for basic needs?

**3. Resistance Potential**
- What makes an AI application structurally difficult to commodify?
- How can tools be designed to remain community-controlled?
- What features would make corporate co-optation unlikely or impossible?

**4. Temporal and Crisis Analysis**
- How do community needs change during crisis moments or system failures?
- What tools become essential when capitalist infrastructure breaks down?
- How can AI applications evolve with communities rather than becoming obsolete?
- What's the typical lifecycle of resistance tools before neutralization?

**5. Knowledge Systems Integration**
- What local, indigenous, or non-academic knowledge systems need technological support?
- How can AI complement rather than replace community wisdom and embodied knowledge?
- What epistemological assumptions are embedded in proposed technological solutions?
- How do we avoid techno-colonial approaches that dismiss existing practices?

**6. Ecological and Material Considerations**
- What are the environmental costs and benefits of this AI application?
- How does this tool relate to bioregional needs and ecological limits?
- What level of technological dependency is appropriate for community resilience?
- How does this application support or undermine environmental justice?

**7. Security and Repression Resilience**
- How vulnerable is this application to state or corporate interference?
- What security measures protect users without creating barriers to access?
- How can the tool function under conditions of active repression or surveillance?
- What backup systems exist if primary infrastructure is compromised?

**8. Cannae Opportunity Analysis**
Drawing from Joan Westenberg's analysis ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOepYPGJDfE)):
- What mental models does the dominant system treat as unchangeable truth?
- Where does their past success create exploitable blind spots?
- How can community alternatives position themselves as "Hannibal" to capitalism's "Roman legions"?
- What would it look like to turn their greatest strengths into weaknesses?
- When might their rigid orthodoxy lead to a "Cannae moment" of catastrophic failure?

#### Secondary Questions

**Community Needs Assessment**
- What collective challenges do communities face that require coordination?
- Where is care work overwhelming individuals or being neglected?
- What knowledge or skills are siloed when they could benefit everyone?

**System Vulnerabilities**
- Where are capitalist systems brittle or dependent on information control?
- What alternative economic models need better coordination tools?
- How could transparency tools expose harmful corporate practices?

**Scaling and Sustainability**
- How can AI applications grow without requiring venture capital?
- What governance models prevent mission drift toward profit maximization?
- How can communities maintain technical sovereignty over their tools?
- What federation models allow tool interconnection while preserving local control?
- How do tools evolve with communities rather than becoming obsolete or co-opted?

**Network Effects and Interconnection**
- How do multiple anti-capitalist AI tools reinforce each other's effectiveness?
- What happens when these applications reach critical mass or threaten existing power?
- How can cross-community knowledge sharing occur without homogenization?
- What are the trade-offs between local adaptation and broader coordination?

**Crisis and Resilience Planning**
- How do these tools function during economic, political, or environmental crises?
- What backup systems exist when primary infrastructure fails or is compromised?
- How can applications be designed for use under conditions of active repression?
- What security measures protect vulnerable users without creating barriers to access?

### Strategic Positioning Against Mental Model Rigidity

Based on the Cannae Problem analysis, position anti-capitalist AI applications to exploit systemic blind spots:

#### Identifying Orthodox Vulnerabilities
- **Scale Fixation**: Deploy deliberately unscalable, hyperlocal solutions
- **Efficiency Obsession**: Build redundant, care-centered systems
- **Individual Responsibility**: Create collective solutions to "individual" problems
- **Monetization Imperative**: Develop robust gift economies
- **Competition Ideology**: Demonstrate superior outcomes through cooperation

#### Creating Strategic Advantages
As Westenberg notes: "Hannibal didn't try to beat the Romans at their own game. He completely reframed the problem."

For anti-capitalist AI:
1. Never compete on capitalist metrics (ROI, growth, efficiency)
2. Create new success measures that capitalism cannot compute
3. Position solutions where mental model blind spots are largest
4. Prepare to act decisively during system "Cannae moments"

### Application Process
1. **Identify the Gap** - What human need is currently unmet or poorly served?
2. **Analyze the Failure** - Why isn't capitalism addressing this need adequately?
3. **Map Mental Models** - What orthodox beliefs prevent the dominant system from seeing alternatives?
4. **Map Power Relations** - Who benefits from the current situation and who suffers?
5. **Explore AI Potential** - How could AI/LLM capabilities address the underlying issue?
6. **Design for Anti-Capture** - What features would prevent commodification?
7. **Position Strategically** - How can this exploit identified mental model rigidities?
8. **Test Community Fit** - Does this actually serve identified community needs and knowledge systems?
9. **Plan for Sustainability** - How can this exist and grow outside capitalist frameworks?
10. **Assess Ecological Impact** - What are the environmental costs and appropriate technology considerations?
11. **Security and Resilience Planning** - How does this function under crisis or repression conditions?
12. **Network Integration** - How does this connect with other anti-capitalist tools and communities?

#### Avoiding Our Own Cannae
As Westenberg warns: "Success creates its own failure mechanisms."
- What orthodoxies are we developing that could become vulnerabilities?
- Where might our success create rigidity that prevents adaptation?
- How do we maintain strategic flexibility while building alternatives?
- What practices ensure we question our own mental models?
- When do our strengths (solidarity, consensus, ideological clarity) become weaknesses?

### Further Development
This framework requires iterative refinement through:
- Testing with specific community organizing contexts
- Feedback from technologists working on alternative projects
- Case study analysis of successful and failed attempts
- Integration with broader anti-capitalist theoretical frameworks
