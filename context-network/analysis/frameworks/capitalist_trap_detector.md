### Trap Detection Categories

#### The Efficiency Trap
**Pattern:** Promises to make existing exploitative systems more efficient rather than questioning their fundamental structure.

**Warning Signs:**
- Focuses on optimizing labor extraction rather than reducing exploitation
- Automates surveillance or control mechanisms
- Increases productivity demands on workers
- Reduces human autonomy in decision-making
- Frames problems as inefficiencies rather than structural inequities

**Example Analyses:**
- "AI scheduling optimization" → May intensify precarious work patterns
- "Predictive healthcare" → May optimize insurance company profits over patient care
- "Smart city efficiency" → May optimize for capital flows rather than community wellbeing

**Strengthening Questions:**
- How can we address the underlying need without accepting exploitative premises?
- What would meeting this need look like if worker/community autonomy were prioritized?
- How can technology reduce rather than intensify labor demands?

#### The Individualization Trap
**Pattern:** Converts collective problems into individual technical solutions, obscuring systemic causes.

**Warning Signs:**
- Frames structural problems as personal optimization challenges
- Provides individual solutions to collective problems
- Reduces political issues to technical or behavioral ones
- Promotes "choice" within constrained options
- Shifts responsibility from institutions to individuals

**Example Analyses:**
- "Personal carbon footprint AI" → Obscures corporate environmental responsibility
- "Financial wellness apps" → Individualizes poverty and economic precarity
- "Mental health AI coaches" → Depoliticizes mental health impacts of oppressive systems

**Strengthening Questions:**
- What collective action would address the root cause of this problem?
- How can technology support community-level responses rather than individual coping?
- What would solidarity-based solutions look like instead of self-help approaches?

#### The Platform Dependency Trap
**Pattern:** Creates dependence on corporate-controlled infrastructure while appearing to empower users.

**Warning Signs:**
- Requires proprietary platforms or corporate accounts
- Centralizes data or decision-making power
- Creates network effects that lock in corporate control
- Offers convenience in exchange for autonomy
- Makes alternatives technically difficult or socially costly

**Example Analyses:**
- "Community organizing on corporate social media" → Subjects organizing to corporate surveillance and control
- "Gig economy platforms with better worker features" → Still extracts value while maintaining precarity
- "AI tutoring through tech company platforms" → Creates educational dependency on corporate infrastructure

**Strengthening Questions:**
- How can this function without corporate infrastructure?
- What would community-owned versions of this capability look like?
- How can we build network effects that strengthen communities rather than corporations?

#### The Data Extraction Trap
**Pattern:** Provides services in exchange for data that becomes a source of profit or control.

**Warning Signs:**
- Requires extensive personal or community data collection
- Uses data for purposes beyond the stated service
- Creates detailed profiles that could be monetized or weaponized
- Makes data deletion or portability difficult
- Obscures how data will be used long-term

**Example Analyses:**
- "Free AI health advice" → May be building proprietary health databases for pharmaceutical companies
- "Community resource matching AI" → May be mapping community networks for surveillance or marketing
- "Educational AI assistants" → May be profiling students for future marketing or social control

**Strengthening Questions:**
- How can this service function with minimal data collection?
- How can communities maintain control over their own data?
- What are the long-term risks of this data existing in centralized form?

#### The Innovation Theater Trap
**Pattern:** Generates excitement about technological progress while maintaining existing power structures.

**Warning Signs:**
- Emphasizes novelty over actual improvement in material conditions
- Pilot projects that never scale or get defunded
- Solutions that work for privileged users but fail for marginalized communities
- Technology that impresses stakeholders but doesn't serve community needs
- Metrics focused on adoption rather than liberation or wellbeing

**Example Analyses:**
- "AI-powered homeless services" → May create surveillance systems rather than addressing housing as a human right
- "Blockchain voting systems" → May distract from voter suppression and gerrymandering
- "AI bias detection tools" → May provide cover for continued discriminatory practices

**Strengthening Questions:**
- What material improvements would this create for the most marginalized?
- How do we measure success in terms of power redistribution rather than technological sophistication?
- What unsexy, fundamental changes would actually address this problem?

#### The Gatekeeping Trap
**Pattern:** Creates new forms of access control while appearing to democratize resources.

**Warning Signs:**
- Algorithmic systems that determine access to resources
- "Objective" scoring systems that embed existing biases
- Technical barriers that exclude less privileged users
- Credential or verification requirements that reproduce existing hierarchies
- Centralized decision-making disguised as algorithmic neutrality

**Example Analyses:**
- "AI-based loan approvals" → May digitize and obscure discriminatory lending practices
- "Algorithmic job matching" → May perpetuate employment discrimination through technical means
- "AI content moderation" → May suppress marginalized voices while protecting corporate interests

**Strengthening Questions:**
- How can communities make these decisions democratically rather than algorithmically?
- What would universal access look like instead of algorithmic filtering?
- How can we design systems that actively counter existing biases rather than encoding them?

### Solution Strengthening Process

#### Phase 1: Structural Analysis
**Power Relations Audit:**
- Who ultimately controls this technology and its development?
- Where does the funding come from and what strings are attached?
- What power dynamics does this technology reinforce or challenge?
- Who profits from this solution existing vs. not existing?

**Dependency Mapping:**
- What corporate infrastructure does this rely on?
- What happens if key corporate actors withdraw support or change terms?
- How much technical knowledge is required to maintain this independently?
- What alternative infrastructure would be needed for community control?

**Data and Surveillance Assessment:**
- What data is collected and how is it stored?
- Who has access to this data now and in the future?
- What surveillance capabilities does this create or enable?
- How could this data be weaponized against communities?

#### Phase 2: Community Centering
**Affected Community Analysis:**
- Who is most impacted by the problem this technology addresses?
- Are these communities leading the solution development?
- How does this solution align with community-defined priorities?
- What unintended consequences might this create for vulnerable populations?

**Cultural and Epistemological Fit:**
- Does this solution respect diverse ways of knowing and being?
- How does this interact with existing community practices and wisdom?
- What cultural assumptions are embedded in the technological approach?
- How can this be adapted to different cultural contexts rather than imposing universality?

**Self-Determination Assessment:**
- Does this increase or decrease community autonomy?
- How much control do communities have over how this technology evolves?
- What governance structures exist for community input and decision-making?
- How can communities exit or modify this solution if it stops serving them?

#### Phase 3: Anti-Capitalist Design
**Commons Building:**
- How does this contribute to shared resources rather than private accumulation?
- What knowledge or capabilities does this make available to communities?
- How does this strengthen collective capacity rather than individual consumption?
- What would community ownership of this technology look like?

**Solidarity Integration:**
- How does this connect communities in mutual support rather than competition?
- What opportunities for cross-community learning and resource sharing does this create?
- How does this build collective power rather than fragmenting resistance?
- What would federation or confederation of these solutions look like?

**Economic Model Analysis:**
- How is this funded in ways that don't compromise community control?
- What alternative economic relationships does this enable or strengthen?
- How does this reduce dependence on capitalist markets rather than just competing within them?
- What would sustainable, non-extractive funding look like long-term?

#### Phase 4: Resilience and Evolution
**Crisis Resilience:**
- How does this function during economic, political, or environmental crises?
- What backup systems exist if primary infrastructure fails?
- How does this strengthen community resilience rather than creating new vulnerabilities?
- What would this look like under conditions of state repression or corporate retaliation?

**Evolutionary Capacity:**
- How can this adapt to changing community needs over time?
- What prevents this from becoming rigid or obsolete?
- How are new voices and perspectives integrated into ongoing development?
- What prevents mission drift or co-optation as this solution grows?

**Security and Protection:**
- How does this protect vulnerable community members?
- What security culture practices are integrated into the design?
- How does this resist infiltration or sabotage?
- What are the operational security implications for users and communities?
