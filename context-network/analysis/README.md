# Analysis Directory Index

## Overview
This directory contains the core analytical outputs of the Myceliary project, including frameworks, patterns, findings, and relationships discovered through research. **NEW**: Enhanced with opportunity-to-implementation lifecycle support.

## Recent Additions (2025-07-23)
Based on Joan Westenberg's Cannae Problem analysis:
- **patterns/mental_model_trap_patterns.md** - Identifies capitalist/individualist mental model vulnerabilities
- **findings/cannae_problem_discovery.md** - Key insights on exploiting systemic blind spots
- **findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md** - Specific AI/software opportunities exploiting capitalist blind spots
- Updated **frameworks/capitalist_trap_detector.md** - Added Mental Model Rigidity Trap
- Updated **frameworks/anti_capitalist_framework.md** - Added Cannae Opportunity Analysis

## NEW: Opportunity-to-Implementation Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Strategic Opportunity (findings/)
- **Input**: Cannae-style vulnerability analysis
- **Output**: Strategic opportunity document (like cannae_ai_opportunities.md)
- **Location**: `findings/[opportunity_name]_opportunities.md`

### Stage 2: Technical Specification (implementations/technical_specifications/)
- **Input**: Strategic opportunity + community needs assessment
- **Output**: Detailed technical architecture and requirements
- **Location**: `implementations/technical_specifications/[project_name]_spec.md`

### Stage 3: Design Document (implementations/design_documents/)
- **Input**: Technical specification + user research
- **Output**: UI/UX mockups, system design, data models
- **Location**: `implementations/design_documents/[project_name]_design.md`

### Stage 4: Proof of Concept (implementations/proof_of_concepts/)
- **Input**: Design document + minimal viable features
- **Output**: Working prototype + validation learnings
- **Location**: `implementations/proof_of_concepts/[project_name]_poc.md`

### Stage 5: Production Guide (implementations/production_guides/)
- **Input**: Validated proof of concept + community pilot feedback
- **Output**: Complete implementation guide for community deployment
- **Location**: `implementations/production_guides/[project_name]_production.md`

## Navigation Guide

### For Strategic Planning
1. Start with **frameworks/anti_capitalist_framework.md**
2. Review **patterns/mental_model_trap_patterns.md** for exploitation opportunities
3. Check **findings/cannae_problem_discovery.md** for strategic positioning
4. Explore **findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md** for specific opportunities

### For Implementation Development
1. Select opportunity from **findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md**
2. Create technical specification in **implementations/technical_specifications/**
3. Develop design document in **implementations/design_documents/** 
4. Build proof of concept per **implementations/proof_of_concepts/**
5. Create production guide in **implementations/production_guides/**

### For Trap Detection
1. Start with **frameworks/capitalist_trap_detector.md**
2. Review specific trap patterns in the patterns directory
3. Check case studies for real-world examples

### For Platform Development
1. Review **frameworks/ai_platform_cooperative_development.md**
2. Check **patterns/p2p_platform_patterns.md**
3. Study **findings/platform_cooperative_ai_opportunity.md**
