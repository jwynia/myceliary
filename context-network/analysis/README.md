# Analysis Directory Index

## Overview
This directory contains the core analytical outputs of the Myceliary project, including frameworks, patterns, findings, and relationships discovered through research.

## Recent Additions (2025-07-23)
Based on Joan Westenberg's Cannae Problem analysis:
- **patterns/mental_model_trap_patterns.md** - Identifies capitalist/individualist mental model vulnerabilities
- **findings/cannae_problem_discovery.md** - Key insights on exploiting systemic blind spots
- Updated **frameworks/capitalist_trap_detector.md** - Added Mental Model Rigidity Trap
- Updated **frameworks/anti_capitalist_framework.md** - Added Cannae Opportunity Analysis

## Directory Structure

### frameworks/
Core analytical frameworks for identifying and evaluating anti-capitalist AI applications:
- **anti_capitalist_framework.md** - Framework for identifying AI applications outside capitalist incentives
- **capitalist_trap_detector.md** - Methods to identify when AI solutions serve capitalist interests
- **ai_platform_cooperative_development.md** - Framework for developing platform cooperatives
- **exploitative_app_evaluation_framework.md** - Framework for evaluating exploitative platforms
- **p2p_typescript_framework.md** - Technical framework for P2P applications
- **second_order_effects_framework.md** - Analysis of systemic impacts

### patterns/
Recurring patterns identified across analyses:
- **mental_model_trap_patterns.md** - How capitalist mental models create vulnerabilities
- **p2p_platform_patterns.md** - Common patterns in peer-to-peer platforms

### entities/
Key entities (organizations, movements, technologies) identified in research

### relationships/
Documented relationships between entities, patterns, and frameworks

## Navigation Guide

### For Strategic Planning
1. Start with **frameworks/anti_capitalist_framework.md**
2. Review **patterns/mental_model_trap_patterns.md** for exploitation opportunities
3. Check **findings/cannae_problem_discovery.md** for strategic positioning

### For Trap Detection
1. Start with **frameworks/capitalist_trap_detector.md**
2. Review specific trap patterns in the patterns directory
3. Check case studies for real-world examples

### For Platform Development
1. Review **frameworks/ai_platform_cooperative_development.md**
2. Check **patterns/p2p_platform_patterns.md**
3. Study **findings/platform_cooperative_ai_opportunity.md**
