# Research Task: AI Acceleration Examples for Community Software

## Purpose
Document real-world examples of AI being used to accelerate software development for non-profit, mutual aid, and anti-capitalist purposes. Focus on understanding cascade effects and patterns that can inform future projects.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Research Task
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Open
- **Estimated Effort:** 10-15 hours

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions
1. What community organizations have successfully used AI to build custom software?
2. What were the time and cost savings compared to traditional development?
3. What cascade effects resulted from having custom tools?
4. How did communities maintain the software after initial development?
5. What patterns emerge across different use cases?

### Secondary Questions
1. What AI tools/models were most effective for community development?
2. How did non-technical organizers participate in the development process?
3. What security and privacy considerations emerged?
4. How did communities avoid creating new dependencies?
5. What failures or limitations were encountered?

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Case Discovery
- Search for documented examples in:
  - Non-profit technology publications
  - Mutual aid network forums
  - Open source project repositories
  - Community organizing spaces
  - Developer blogs and case studies

### Phase 2: Deep Dive Analysis
For each significant example found:
- Document the organization and their needs
- Analyze the development process used
- Calculate time/cost savings
- Identify cascade effects
- Extract reusable patterns

### Phase 3: Pattern Synthesis
- Group examples by pattern type (crisis response, unprofitable tools, etc.)
- Identify common success factors
- Document common pitfalls
- Create recommendations for future projects

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Case Study Collection
**Format**: Individual markdown files for each significant example
**Content**:
- Organization background and needs
- Development process and timeline
- AI tools and approaches used
- Outcomes and impact
- Lessons learned

### 2. Pattern Analysis Report
**Format**: Synthesis document linking to case studies
**Content**:
- Common patterns across cases
- Success factors and prerequisites
- Failure modes and how to avoid them
- Recommendations for different contexts

### 3. Practical Guide
**Format**: How-to guide for communities
**Content**:
- When AI acceleration makes sense
- How to get started
- Tool recommendations
- Security considerations
- Sustainability planning

## Search Starting Points

### Potential Sources
- **Tech for Good Communities**: NetSquared, TechSoup forums
- **Mutual Aid Networks**: Mutual Aid Hub, local network documentation
- **Developer Communities**: Dev.to, Hacker News (filtered for relevant content)
- **Academic Research**: Papers on civic tech and community technology
- **Open Source Projects**: GitHub topics like "nonprofit", "mutual-aid", "community"

- Practical guide creation
- Review and refinement

## Integration Points

### Connection to Existing Work
- Links to: [[analysis/patterns/ai_development_acceleration_patterns.md]]
- Informs: [[planning/high_leverage_projects.md]] AI acceleration tools
- Validates: [[analysis/frameworks/second_order_effects_framework.md]]

### Expected Contributions
- Real-world validation of theoretical patterns
- Concrete examples for communities to learn from
- Identification of new patterns not yet documented
- Contact network for future collaboration

## Notes for Researchers

### Ethical Considerations
- Get permission before detailed documentation of any project
- Respect security culture of organizing groups
- Don't expose groups to unwanted attention
- Focus on consensual public information

### Quality Indicators
- Preference for first-hand accounts over second-hand reporting
- Look for documented outcomes, not just intentions
- Seek diverse examples across different contexts
- Balance success stories with honest failure analysis
