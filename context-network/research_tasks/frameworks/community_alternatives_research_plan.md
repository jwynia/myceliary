# Research Plan: Community Alternatives to Exploitative Commercial Apps

## Research Objective

Identify and analyze opportunities for community-driven alternatives to commercial applications that exploit users through data harvesting, excessive fees, or other extractive business models. Build a comprehensive framework for evaluating and developing community clones that prioritize mutual aid and collective benefit.

## Research Questions

1. **Mapping Exploitation**: Which categories of commercial apps employ the most exploitative business models?
2. **Technical Feasibility**: What makes certain apps easier or harder to replicate as community alternatives?
3. **Existing Solutions**: What community alternatives already exist, and what can we learn from them?
4. **Implementation Patterns**: What technical and organizational patterns enable successful community alternatives?
5. **Sustainability Models**: How can community alternatives sustain themselves without replicating exploitative practices?
