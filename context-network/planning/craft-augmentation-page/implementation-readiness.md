# Implementation Readiness Checklist

## Planning Deliverables âœ…

### Required Documentation
- âœ… Problem definition in context network
- âœ… Research findings documented  
- âœ… Architecture design with structure
- âœ… Task breakdown with estimates
- âœ… Risk assessment completed
- âœ… Implementation readiness checklist (this document)

### Architecture Artifacts
- âœ… High-level page structure documented
- âœ… Content sections specified
- âœ… Navigation flow defined
- âœ… Cross-linking strategy planned
- âœ… Visual elements identified

### Planning Artifacts
- âœ… 7 scoped tasks identified
- âœ… Implementation order determined
- âœ… Time estimates provided (45-60 min core)
- âœ… Success metrics defined

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

### Understanding
- âœ… Problem clearly defined: Transform technical spec to emphasize worker control
- âœ… Requirements documented: Worker agency as central theme
- âœ… Constraints identified: Jekyll structure, single markdown file
- âœ… Key principle validated: Control differentiates augmentation from automation

### Design
- âœ… Page architecture documented: 10 main sections planned
- âœ… Content flow specified: Hook â†’ Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Proof â†’ Action
- âœ… Messaging strategy defined: "You choose" throughout
- âœ… Example structure chosen: 5 crafts with choice demonstrations

### Planning
- âœ… Tasks broken down: 7 core tasks + 3 optional enhancements
- âœ… Dependencies mapped: Linear progression identified
- âœ… Risks assessed: 12 risks with mitigations
- âœ… Order determined: Start with control principle

### Resources Available
- âœ… Source material exists: 390-line technical specification
- âœ… Parent page ready: augmentation-not-automation.md already links
- âœ… Examples documented: 5 craft domains with specifics
- âœ… Governance model defined: In technical spec

## Implementation Ready Status

### ðŸŸ¢ GREEN LIGHT for Implementation

**Ready to proceed because:**
1. Complete source material available
2. Clear architectural plan created
3. Worker control principle well-defined
4. Concrete task breakdown completed
5. Risks identified and mitigated
6. Time estimate reasonable (45-60 min)

### Critical Success Factors

**Must achieve:**
1. Worker control unmistakably clear
2. Concrete craft examples provided
3. Economic benefits to workers shown
4. Governance by community explained
5. Clear distinction from automation

### First Task to Execute

**Start with Task 1**: Create page file with Jekyll structure
- Location: `/docs/cannae/craft-augmentation.md`
- Time: 5 minutes
- No dependencies

Then immediately proceed to Task 2 (Control Principle) as this sets the entire tone.

## Post-Implementation Validation

### Success Indicators
- [ ] Page renders correctly in Jekyll site
- [ ] Navigation links work properly
- [ ] Control message appears above fold
- [ ] All 5 craft examples included
- [ ] Calls to action are clear
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Worker agency emphasized throughout

### Review Questions
1. Would a craftsperson understand they control the technology?
2. Is the difference from automation crystal clear?
3. Are the economic benefits to workers evident?
4. Can developers understand how to contribute?
5. Is the anti-capitalist stance unmistakable?

## Summary

**Planning Phase Complete**

All planning deliverables have been created. The implementation path is clear with worker control as the central organizing principle. The 390-line technical specification provides comprehensive source material. Task breakdown shows 45-60 minutes for core implementation.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation using the task breakdown, emphasizing worker control in every section.
