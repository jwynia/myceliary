# Research Findings - Craft Augmentation Page

## Key Discoveries from Technical Specification

### 1. Core Architecture Elements

#### The Intelligent Apprentice System
- **Central Metaphor**: AI as apprentice, not master
- **Key Components**:
  - Human-Centered Task Analyzer
  - Joy Detection algorithms
  - Skill Preservation systems
  - Meaning Protection mechanisms

#### Worker Control Mechanisms
- **Task Classification**: Workers define what remains human vs what gets assistance
- **Override Authority**: Individual override on any assistance
- **Customization Levels**: Skill-appropriate assistance levels
- **Disable Features**: Any automated features can be turned off

### 2. Specific Craft Domain Examples

From the spec's implementation examples:

#### Woodworking
- **Worker Chooses to Augment**: Grain pattern analysis, joint optimization suggestions
- **Worker Keeps Manual**: Hand carving, aesthetic decisions, finishing touches
- **Economic Benefit**: Better material usage, reduced waste, premium pricing for optimized work

#### Textiles
- **Worker Chooses to Augment**: Pattern generation for ideas, tension monitoring
- **Worker Keeps Manual**: Weaving rhythm, color choices, fabric feel decisions
- **Economic Benefit**: Faster prototyping, consistent quality, unique designs

#### Cooking
- **Worker Chooses to Augment**: Timing coordination, temperature monitoring
- **Worker Keeps Manual**: Flavor decisions, plating aesthetics, recipe creativity
- **Economic Benefit**: Reduced stress, consistent results, creative freedom

#### Metalwork
- **Worker Chooses to Augment**: Heat management calculations, stress analysis
- **Worker Keeps Manual**: Hammer work, shaping decisions, artistic elements
- **Economic Benefit**: Safety improvements, material optimization, quality consistency

#### Pottery
- **Worker Chooses to Augment**: Glaze chemistry calculations, kiln scheduling
- **Worker Keeps Manual**: Clay shaping, surface decoration, artistic vision
- **Economic Benefit**: Reduced failed firings, glaze innovation, time savings

### 3. Governance and Economic Models

#### Community Control Points
- Craftspeople define automation boundaries
- Communities set feature development priorities
- Individual guilds manage knowledge sharing
- Economic models are cooperatively governed

#### Data Ownership Structure
- Craft knowledge owned by creating craftsperson
- Technique documentation under community stewardship
- Innovation patterns in shared commons with attribution
- Economic data private and protected

### 4. Key Differentiators from Automation

#### What Makes This Augmentation Not Automation
1. **Agency**: Worker chooses what to augment
2. **Purpose**: Frees time for preferred tasks, not cost cutting
3. **Benefits**: Flow to workers, not owners
4. **Control**: Community-governed, not corporate-controlled
5. **Values**: Preserves joy and meaning, not just efficiency

### 5. Technical Implementation Details

#### Architecture Principles
- Local-first (works without internet)
- Privacy preserving (craft knowledge stays local)
- Open source (no vendor lock-in)
- Modular design (communities can modify)

#### Integration Approach
- Works with existing craft practices
- Non-invasive tool integration
- Craftsperson-manageable maintenance
- User-controlled update timing

## Insights for Page Structure

### Narrative Arc
1. Start with worker control as fundamental principle
2. Use concrete examples showing choice in action
3. Contrast with imposed automation scenarios
4. Show economic benefits flowing to workers
5. End with governance and community control

### Key Messages to Emphasize
- "You choose what to augment, not your boss"
- "Free your energy for the work you love"
- "Enhance your best skills, delegate the tedious"
- "Technology that respects your expertise"
- "Benefits flow to those doing the work"

### Visual/Conceptual Elements
- Decision tree showing worker choice points
- Before/after scenarios for each craft
- Governance structure diagram
- Economic flow comparison (augmentation vs automation)

## Gaps to Address

### What the Spec Doesn't Cover
1. Specific implementation timelines
2. Funding/resource requirements details
3. Real-world case studies (spec is prospective)
4. Technical skill requirements for setup

### What We Need to Add
1. Clear call-to-action for craftspeople
2. Developer onboarding guide references
3. Links to funding resources
4. Community formation guidance

## Risk Considerations

### Potential Misunderstandings
- Could be seen as "automation-lite" if control aspect not emphasized
- Might seem too technical for craftspeople
- Could appear idealistic without concrete examples

### Mitigation Strategies
- Lead with control and choice
- Use craft-specific language, not tech jargon
- Ground in real craft challenges and solutions
- Show incremental adoption path
