# Risk Assessment - Craft Augmentation Page

## Identified Risks

### Risk 1: Misunderstood as "Friendly Automation"
**Description**: Readers might see this as just a nicer version of automation that still eventually replaces workers

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High

**Mitigation**:
- Lead with control principle in hero section
- Use explicit "NOT automation" language
- Show concrete examples of worker veto power
- Emphasize economic benefits staying with workers

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Feedback using "efficiency" language
- Questions about "scaling" or "productivity"
- Comparisons to existing automation tools

---

### Risk 8: Developer Audience Feels Excluded
**Description**: Focus on workers might alienate potential developer contributors

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation**:
- Include clear developer call-to-action
- Link to technical specification
- Show technical challenges worth solving
- Emphasize social impact opportunity

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Low developer engagement
- "Not for me" responses from tech community
- Lack of implementation interest

## Implementation Risks

### Risk 9: Jekyll Build or Display Issues

- User frustration with dead links
- Requests for missing resources

## Political/Strategic Risks

### Risk 11: Capitalist Co-option Potential
**Description**: Corporations might adopt language while subverting intent

**Probability**: High (eventually)

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Project Risk Level**: LOW to MEDIUM

**Rationale**: Most risks are messaging/communication related rather than technical. These can be mitigated through careful writing and review. The core concept is sound and well-documented in the technical spec.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. Maintain focus on worker control throughout
2. Use concrete, relatable examples
3. Keep technical details accessible
4. Emphasize economic benefits to workers
5. Respect traditional craft knowledge

## Risk Monitoring Plan

### Weekly Review Points
- Check community feedback channels
- Monitor engagement metrics
- Review questions and confusions
- Track implementation interest

### Adjustment Triggers
- Consistent misunderstanding of core concepts
- Low engagement from target audience
- Technical barriers to comprehension
- Political/philosophical objections

### Contingency Plans
- **If too technical**: Create separate "simple" version
- **If misunderstood**: Add FAQ section
- **If seems unrealistic**: Feature early implementations
- **If control message lost**: Restructure with control first
