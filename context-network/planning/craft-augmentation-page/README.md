# Craft Augmentation Page Planning

## Problem Definition

### What We're Solving
We need to transform a 390-line technical specification into accessible public documentation that clearly demonstrates how AI can augment human craft work without replacing workers. The key differentiator is **worker control** over what gets augmented.

### Why This Matters
- **Philosophical Core**: This exemplifies Myceliary's anti-capitalist AI approach
- **Practical Impact**: Shows concrete alternatives to automation that displaces workers
- **Community Need**: Craftspeople need to understand how AI can serve them, not replace them
- **Strategic Value**: Exploits the "Automation Absolutism" blind spot in capitalist thinking

### Key Stakeholders
1. **Craftspeople**: Need to see how this preserves their agency and livelihood
2. **Developers**: Need clear implementation guidance for building these tools
3. **Communities**: Need governance models for controlling augmentation technology
4. **Funders**: Need to understand the value proposition beyond efficiency

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Worker control is the central, unmistakable theme
- [ ] Clear contrast between augmentation (worker-chosen) vs automation (imposed)
- [ ] Concrete examples from 5 craft domains showing worker choice
- [ ] Accessible to non-technical craftspeople
- [ ] Actionable for developers wanting to build these tools
- [ ] Demonstrates economic benefits flowing to workers, not just owners

## Current State

### Existing Resources
- **Technical Specification**: `/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/craft_augmentation_ai.md` (390 lines)
- **Overview Page**: `/docs/cannae/augmentation-not-automation.md` (already links to future page)
- **Key Insight**: "Who controls what gets augmented" is the differentiator

### Identified Gaps
- No public-facing documentation of the technical spec
- Worker control principle not explicitly centered in existing materials
- Missing concrete examples of worker choice in augmentation
- No clear governance models for community control

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Transform technical architecture into accessible narrative
2. Center worker agency and control throughout
3. Provide concrete examples of worker-chosen augmentation
4. Include governance and economic models
5. Link appropriately to existing documentation

### Non-functional Requirements
1. **Accessibility**: Understandable by non-technical craftspeople
2. **Actionability**: Developers can use this to build tools
3. **Inspirational**: Motivates communities to pursue this approach
4. **Defensive**: Clearly distinguishes from capitalist automation

### Constraints
- Must work within Jekyll site structure
- Should complement, not duplicate, existing augmentation page
- Cannot require external dependencies or complex builds
- Must be complete in single markdown file

### Key Messages to Convey
1. "You choose what to augment, not your boss"
2. "Free your energy for the work you love"
3. "Technology that respects your expertise"
4. "Benefits flow to those doing the work"
5. "Community-owned, worker-controlled"
