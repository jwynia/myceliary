## Detailed Section Design

### 1. Hero Section
**Purpose**: Immediately establish worker control as the differentiator
```markdown
# Craft Augmentation AI: You Choose What Gets Enhanced
{: .fs-9 }

AI that respects your expertise and amplifies your craft—on your terms
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
```

### 2. The Control Principle (MOST IMPORTANT)
**Purpose**: Define augmentation vs automation through control lens
**Key Content**:
- Who decides what gets augmented (worker vs boss)
- Visual comparison of decision flows
- "Free your time for what you love" messaging

### 3. The Problem Space
**Purpose**: Contrast current automation threats with augmentation opportunity
**Structure**:
- What capitalism does: Replace workers to cut costs
- What workers need: Tools that enhance without replacing
- The opportunity: Worker-controlled enhancement

### 4. Our Solution: The Intelligent Apprentice
**Purpose**: Introduce the technical approach in accessible terms
**Key Elements**:
- Apprentice metaphor explanation
- Core principles (from spec)
- How it preserves craft joy and meaning

### 5. How Workers Stay in Control
**Purpose**: Concrete mechanisms showing worker agency
**Content Structure**:
```
For Each Control Point:
- What you control
- How you control it
- What happens if you say no
- Real example
```

### 6. Craft Domain Examples
**Purpose**: Show control in action across different crafts
**Template per craft**:
```markdown
### [Craft Name]

**You Choose to Augment:**
- [Tedious task 1]
- [Safety-related task]
- [Calculation-heavy task]

**You Keep Manual:**
- [Creative decision]
- [Skilled technique]
- [Meaningful process]

**Your Benefits:**
- [Time saved for X]
- [Energy freed for Y]
- [Economic gain Z]
```

### 7. Technical Architecture (Simplified)
**Purpose**: Show it's real and buildable without overwhelming
**Key Points**:
- Local-first (your data stays yours)
- Open source (no corporate control)
- Modular (adapt to your needs)
- Simple diagram of components

### 8. Community Governance
**Purpose**: Show collective control mechanisms
**Elements**:
- How guilds/coops govern the tools
- Decision-making processes
- Knowledge sharing protocols
- Economic model participation

### 9. Economic Model
**Purpose**: Demonstrate benefits flow to workers
**Comparisons**:
- Automation: Profits to owners, workers displaced
- Augmentation: Benefits to workers, sustainable livelihoods

### 10. Getting Started
**Purpose**: Clear calls to action for different audiences
**Segments**:
- For Craftspeople (assess, connect, experiment)
- For Developers (understand, build, support)
- For Communities (organize, govern, sustain)

## Content Flow Strategy

### Narrative Journey
1. **Hook**: You're in control (not your boss)
2. **Problem**: Automation threatens your craft
3. **Solution**: Augmentation that serves you
4. **Proof**: Concrete examples of worker choice
5. **How**: Technical and governance mechanisms
6. **Action**: Join/build/support the movement

### Emotional Arc
1. **Recognition**: "Yes, that's my fear about AI"
2. **Hope**: "There's another way?"
3. **Understanding**: "I see how this is different"
4. **Excitement**: "This could help my craft"
5. **Empowerment**: "I can be part of this"

## Visual Elements Plan

### Diagrams Needed
1. **Decision Flow Comparison**
   - Automation: Boss → Technology → Worker displacement
   - Augmentation: Worker → Choice → Enhanced craft

2. **Control Points Map**
   - Visual showing all the places workers have control

3. **Craft Enhancement Examples**
   - Before/after scenarios for each craft

4. **Governance Structure**
   - How communities control development

5. **Economic Flow**
   - Where value goes in each model

## Cross-Linking Strategy

### Internal Links
- TO: `/cannae/augmentation-not-automation` (parent page)
- TO: `/frameworks/` (anti-capitalist framework)
- TO: `/organization/` (governance models)

### External Resources
- Technical specification (full version)
- Implementation guides
- Funding resources
- Community forums

## Accessibility Considerations

### Language Choices
- Use "worker" not "user" or "operator"
- Use "craft" not "output" or "product"  
- Use "enhance" not "optimize" or "improve"
- Use "choose" not "configure" or "set"

### Technical Translation
- Complex: "Task decomposition with human-value weighting"
- Simple: "The system learns what parts of your work bring you joy"

- Complex: "Context-aware suggestion systems"
- Simple: "It suggests help only when and where you want it"

## Success Metrics

### Page Effectiveness Indicators
1. **Clarity**: Reader understands control difference immediately
2. **Relevance**: Craftspeople see themselves in examples
3. **Actionability**: Clear next steps for each audience
4. **Differentiation**: Obviously different from automation
5. **Inspiration**: Motivates participation/support

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Elements
- Control principle must appear above the fold
- Worker agency emphasized in every section
- Concrete examples required (not abstract)
- Economic benefits clearly stated
- Governance model explicitly democratic

### Avoid These Pitfalls
- Don't use efficiency/productivity framing
- Don't suggest this makes workers "better" 
- Don't imply technology knows best
- Don't hide the political stance
- Don't make it seem finished/static
