## Optional Enhancement Tasks

### Enhancement A: Add Visual Diagrams
**Scope**:

**Estimated Effort**: 10 minutes
**Value**: High (clarity)

## Implementation Order

### Recommended Sequence
1. Task 1: Create file structure (5 min)
2. Task 2: Hero and control principle (15 min)
3. Task 3: Problem and solution (10 min)
4. Task 4: Control mechanisms (10 min)
5. Task 5: Craft examples (20 min)
6. Task 6: Technical/governance (10 min)
7. Task 7: Calls to action (5 min)

**Total**: 75 minutes (includes buffer)

### Minimum Viable Version
If time constrained, prioritize:
1. Tasks 1-2: Foundation (20 min)
2. Task 5: Craft examples (20 min)
3. Task 7: Calls to action (5 min)

**Minimum Total**: 45 minutes

## Quality Checkpoints

### After Task 2
- Is worker control crystal clear?
- Would a craftsperson immediately understand the difference?

### After Task 5
- Do examples feel real and relatable?
- Is worker choice evident throughout?

### Before Completion
- Does every section reinforce worker agency?
- Are economic benefits to workers clear?
- Is the political stance unmistakable?

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Jekyll build issues
- **Mitigation**: Test with existing page structure

### Content Risks
