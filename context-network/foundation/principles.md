### Core Values

1. **Evidence-Based AI Understanding**
   We commit to examining artificial intelligence through an accurate, evidence-based lens that separates real issues from misconceptions. We use The Multiverse School's AI Problems Index as a key reference to maintain a balanced perspective that acknowledges both legitimate concerns and actual benefits while avoiding common fallacies and oversimplified narratives.

2. **Intellectual Rigor**
   We maintain high standards for evaluating AI-related claims and discussions, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between:
   - Real AI problems that deserve attention and resources
   - Misconceptions that distract from meaningful discourse
   - Broader societal issues that intersect with but aren't unique to AI
   - Environmental considerations with proper context
   - Creative and consciousness implications based on current research

3. **Balanced Perspective**
   We strive to present a comprehensive view of AI that:
   - Acknowledges legitimate concerns without fearmongering
   - Recognizes benefits without overselling
   - Considers environmental impact with proper context
   - Examines creativity and consciousness claims critically
   - Addresses legal and ethical implications thoughtfully

### Design Principles

1. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**
   All project decisions regarding AI must be grounded in verifiable evidence and current research.
   
   *Example:* When discussing AI's environmental impact, we reference specific data about efficiency improvements and distinguish between power generation and environmental problems.

2. **Clear Issue Categorization**
   We maintain clear distinctions between AI-specific issues and broader societal challenges.
   
   *Example:* Labor market changes are examined as broader economic transitions rather than solely AI-driven disruptions.

3. **Balanced Documentation**
   Documentation and discussions must present both challenges and opportunities in AI development.
   
   *Example:* When discussing AI in creative fields, we examine both potential benefits for creators and legitimate concerns about impact.

### Standards and Guidelines

#### Quality Standards

- All AI-related claims must be supported by current research or evidence
- Regular review and updates based on new findings and research
- Clear distinction between established facts and emerging theories

#### Structural Standards

- Systematic categorization of AI-related issues following established frameworks
- Clear separation between AI-specific and general technological challenges
- Regular validation against authoritative sources

#### Safety and Security Standards

- Evidence-based approach to AI safety considerations
- Clear distinction between immediate and speculative risks
- Regular review of current research on AI safety

#### Performance and Efficiency Standards

- Context-aware evaluation of AI system impacts
- Evidence-based assessment of environmental considerations
- Regular review of efficiency metrics and improvements

### Process Principles

1. **Regular Fact-Checking**
   Maintain ongoing verification of AI-related claims against authoritative sources.

2. **Balanced Analysis**
   Ensure comprehensive examination of both benefits and challenges in AI development.

3. **Clear Communication**
   Present AI-related information in clear, accurate, and contextual ways.

### Decision-Making Framework

#### Decision Criteria

- Evidence-based validation of claims
- Clear categorization of issues (AI-specific vs. general)
- Impact assessment based on current research
- Alignment with established ethical principles

#### Trade-off Considerations

- Balance between innovation and responsible development
- Short-term benefits vs. long-term implications
- Individual vs. societal impacts
- Technical capability vs. ethical considerations

### Principle Application

#### When Principles Conflict

When different principles appear to conflict, prioritize:
1. Evidence-based understanding over speculation
2. Comprehensive analysis over simplified narratives
3. Balanced perspective over single-sided views

#### Exceptions to Principles

Exceptions to these principles may be considered when:
- New research provides compelling evidence for reconsideration
- Emerging technologies create previously unconsidered scenarios
- Specific contexts require modified approaches
