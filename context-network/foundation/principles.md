# Project Principles

## Purpose
This document outlines the core principles and standards that guide decision-making and development across the project. These principles operationalize our foundational values into actionable guidelines.

### Relationship to Values
Our principles translate our [core values](values.md) into practical guidelines. While values describe what we believe and aspire toward, principles guide how we act on those beliefs in our daily work.

### Core Principles

#### Community-Centered Principles

1. **Start with Those Most Affected** *(Operationalizes: Collective Liberation, Interdependence)*
   Every initiative begins by centering the communities experiencing the problem. Their wisdom, needs, and visions drive our solutions.
   
   *Example:* Elder care AI development starts with elders and caregivers, not tech capabilities.

2. **Build Power, Not Dependency** *(Operationalizes: Decentralization, Abundance)*
   Our tools should increase community capacity and autonomy, never create reliance on external systems or expertise.
   
   *Example:* Language learning systems designed to make themselves unnecessary over time.

3. **Move at the Speed of Trust** *(Operationalizes: Emergence, Fractal Responsibility)*
   Development pace is determined by relationship depth, not market pressures or technical possibilities.
   
   *Example:* Deploy only where deep community relationships exist.

4. **Collaborate, Don't Compete** *(Operationalizes: Cooperation Over Competition, Abundance)*
   We actively seek opportunities to support and build upon others' work, sharing our own freely and creating mutual benefit.
   
   *Example:* Publishing all code openly, using existing standards, contributing improvements back to projects we build upon.

#### Technical Principles

5. **Distribute by Design** *(Operationalizes: Decentralization, Resilience)*
   Architecture decisions default to distribution of power, data, and control. Centralization requires extraordinary justification.
   
   *Example:* Federated systems where each community controls their node.

6. **Adapt and Evolve** *(Operationalizes: Adaptation, Emergence)*
   Systems must be designed for change, expecting community needs and contexts to shift over time.
   
   *Example:* Architectures that support forking, versioning, and local modification.

7. **Transparency Over Complexity** *(Operationalizes: Trust, Justice)*
   Communities should understand how systems work. Complexity that obscures function serves oppression.
   
   *Example:* Algorithms explained in plain language with community veto power.

#### Analytical Principles

8. **Evidence-Based Understanding** *(Operationalizes: Intellectual Rigor, Justice)*
   We ground our work in verifiable evidence, distinguishing between actual problems and manufactured fears.
   
   *Example:* Using research to separate real AI harms from speculation.

9. **Multiple Ways of Knowing** *(Operationalizes: Radical Imagination, Interdependence)*
   We value lived experience, community wisdom, and non-Western knowledge systems alongside technical expertise.
   
   *Example:* Indigenous data sovereignty principles inform our data architectures.

10. **Root Cause Analysis** *(Operationalizes: Transformative Justice, Liberation)*
    We address systemic issues, not just symptoms, designing solutions that transform conditions creating harm.
   
    *Example:* Food security tools that address distribution systems, not just optimization.

### Design Principles

1. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**
   All project decisions regarding AI must be grounded in verifiable evidence and current research.
   
   *Example:* When discussing AI's environmental impact, we reference specific data about efficiency improvements and distinguish between power generation and environmental problems.

2. **Clear Issue Categorization**
   We maintain clear distinctions between AI-specific issues and broader societal challenges.
   
   *Example:* Labor market changes are examined as broader economic transitions rather than solely AI-driven disruptions.

3. **Balanced Documentation**
   Documentation and discussions must present both challenges and opportunities in AI development.
   
   *Example:* When discussing AI in creative fields, we examine both potential benefits for creators and legitimate concerns about impact.

### Standards and Guidelines

#### Quality Standards

- All AI-related claims must be supported by current research or evidence
- Regular review and updates based on new findings and research
- Clear distinction between established facts and emerging theories

#### Structural Standards

- Systematic categorization of AI-related issues following established frameworks
- Clear separation between AI-specific and general technological challenges
- Regular validation against authoritative sources

#### Safety and Security Standards

- Evidence-based approach to AI safety considerations
- Clear distinction between immediate and speculative risks
- Regular review of current research on AI safety

#### Performance and Efficiency Standards

- Context-aware evaluation of AI system impacts
- Evidence-based assessment of environmental considerations
- Regular review of efficiency metrics and improvements

### Process Principles

1. **Regular Fact-Checking**
   Maintain ongoing verification of AI-related claims against authoritative sources.

2. **Balanced Analysis**
   Ensure comprehensive examination of both benefits and challenges in AI development.

3. **Clear Communication**
   Present AI-related information in clear, accurate, and contextual ways.

### Decision-Making Framework

#### Decision Criteria

- Evidence-based validation of claims
- Clear categorization of issues (AI-specific vs. general)
- Impact assessment based on current research
- Alignment with established ethical principles

#### Trade-off Considerations

- Balance between innovation and responsible development
- Short-term benefits vs. long-term implications
- Individual vs. societal impacts
- Technical capability vs. ethical considerations

### Principle Application

#### When Principles Conflict

When different principles appear to conflict, prioritize:
1. Evidence-based understanding over speculation
2. Comprehensive analysis over simplified narratives
3. Balanced perspective over single-sided views

#### Exceptions to Principles

Exceptions to these principles may be considered when:
- New research provides compelling evidence for reconsideration
- Emerging technologies create previously unconsidered scenarios
- Specific contexts require modified approaches
