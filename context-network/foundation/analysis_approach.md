## Content

### Analysis Philosophy

[Describe the fundamental philosophy guiding the analysis approach, such as:
- Whether the analysis is exploratory or hypothesis-driven
- If the approach is bottom-up (data-driven) or top-down (theory-driven)
- The balance between quantitative and qualitative methods
- The role of human judgment versus automated analysis]
