# Myceliary - Anti-Capitalist AI Framework Project

## Purpose
This node defines the core purpose, scope, and vision of the Myceliary project, which develops and shares frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and building AI and LLM applications that serve human needs outside of or in opposition to capitalist structures.

### Core Problem
Most AI development follows profit-driven patterns, creating tools that optimize exploitation, extract data for corporate benefit, or provide technological solutions to problems created by capitalism itself. Meanwhile, genuine human needs that capitalism systematically ignores or actively harms remain unaddressed by AI innovation. Communities need frameworks to identify these gaps, evaluate proposed solutions for hidden traps, and build genuinely community-controlled alternatives.

### Project Overview
This project focuses on inquiry methodologies, evaluation frameworks, and collaborative tools that help communities and technologists discover opportunities where AI could genuinely serve liberation rather than extraction.

### What We're Building

#### Primary Frameworks
1. **Framework for Identifying Anti-Capitalist AI Applications**
   - Systematic inquiry methodology for discovering AI applications outside capitalist incentives
   - Analysis tools for market failure spaces, counter-hegemonic potential, and democratization opportunities
   - Integration of temporal, ecological, epistemological, and security considerations
   - Community-centered evaluation criteria and implementation guidance

2. **Capitalist Trap Detection and Solution Strengthening Framework**
   - Methods for identifying when AI solutions that appear helpful actually serve capitalist interests
   - Analysis tools for common trap patterns
   - Systematic process for strengthening community-controlled alternatives
   - Evaluation checklists and red flag identification systems

3. **Research Query Framework**
   - Structured approach to ongoing research and monitoring
   - Query categories from basic web search to deep research reports
   - Temporal organization for one-time foundational research and ongoing monitoring
   - Crisis-responsive and geographically diverse research strategies

### Target Audiences

**Primary Users:**
- Community organizers and activists exploring technology tools
- Technologists seeking to redirect their work toward liberatory purposes
- Researchers studying community technology and digital justice
- Cooperative and solidarity economy practitioners
- Digital rights and algorithmic justice advocates

**Secondary Users:**
- Grant makers and funding organizations evaluating community technology projects
- Policy researchers analyzing alternatives to corporate AI development
- Academic researchers in critical technology studies
- Community organizations assessing technology proposals or partnerships

### Scope and Boundaries

**What This Project Includes:**
- Framework Development
- Community Collaboration
- Knowledge Commons Building

**What This Project Excludes:**
- Specific Technology Development
- Prescriptive Solutions
- Corporate Engagement

### Development Approach

**Community-Centered Development**
- Framework development guided by feedback from communities actually using these tools
- Regular testing and iteration based on real-world application experiences
- Governance structures that maintain community accountability
- Integration with existing community technology and organizing networks

**Collaborative Research Model**
- Distributed research conducted by contributors with diverse perspectives
- Research priorities set by community needs
- Open documentation of research process and findings
- Integration of multiple knowledge systems and epistemological approaches

**Anti-Capitalist Infrastructure**
- Project sustainability through grants and donations that don't compromise independence
- Governance structures that prevent mission drift or co-optation
- Technology choices that maintain community control
- Resource sharing with other community technology and organizing projects

### Success Metrics

**Framework Utility**
- Communities successfully using frameworks to identify and evaluate technology opportunities
- Documentation of improved technology decisions and stronger community control
- Framework adaptation and local implementation across diverse community contexts
- Integration with existing community technology and organizing work

**Knowledge Commons Building**
- Growing compilation of research and case studies accessible to communities
- Increased community capacity for technology assessment and development
- Cross-community learning and resource sharing facilitation
- Educational material usage and community technology literacy development

**Anti-Capitalist Impact**
- Communities building and maintaining technology outside corporate control
- Resistance to corporate co-optation of community technology initiatives
- Strengthened community self-determination and reduced dependency on extractive systems
- Integration with broader anti-capitalist organizing and movement building

### Long-Term Vision
This project aims to contribute to a broader ecosystem of community-controlled technology development that serves liberation rather than extraction. We envision communities equipped with analysis tools that help them navigate technological choices with clear anti-capitalist frameworks, resist corporate co-optation of their initiatives, and build genuinely community-controlled alternatives that strengthen collective power and mutual aid.

The frameworks developed here should become tools that communities adapt and improve based on their own needs and contexts, contributing to a knowledge commons that strengthens community technology work across diverse struggles and geographies. Success means these frameworks become unnecessary because communities have internalized the analysis and developed their own locally appropriate tools for community-controlled technology development.
