# Core Values

## Purpose
This document articulates the positive values that drive our work - what we are building toward, not just what we oppose. These values shape our principles, guide our opportunity identification, and define success in our implementations.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Core Foundation
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Conceptual
- **Confidence:** Established

### Foundational Values

#### 1. **Interdependence**
We recognize that all beings and systems are interconnected. Our liberation is bound together - none of us are free until all of us are free. Technology should strengthen these connections rather than isolate us.

**What this means:**
- Building systems that foster connection over competition
- Designing for collective benefit rather than individual gain
- Recognizing that harm to one affects all
- Creating feedback loops that strengthen community bonds

#### 2. **Emergence**
We trust that small actions, aligned with intention, ripple outward to create large-scale change. Complex patterns arise from simple interactions repeated with care and consistency.

**What this means:**
- Starting where we are with what we have
- Building incrementally while holding the larger vision
- Allowing solutions to evolve with communities
- Trusting the process of collective wisdom

#### 3. **Adaptation**
We embrace change as constant and build systems that can transform in response to shifting conditions. Resilience comes from flexibility, not rigidity.

**What this means:**
- Creating systems that can evolve
- Learning from feedback and adjusting
- Building for unknown futures
- Celebrating iteration over perfection

#### 4. **Decentralization**
We distribute power, resources, and decision-making rather than concentrating them. True strength comes from many nodes of leadership and action.

**What this means:**
- No single points of failure
- Communities control their own tools
- Knowledge and skills are widely shared
- Leadership rotates and multiplies

#### 5. **Fractal Responsibility**
The patterns we practice at small scale are the patterns we create at large scale. How we are with each other is how we will be as a movement.

**What this means:**
- Embodying our values in daily practice
- Creating healthy patterns in our teams
- Addressing harm at every level
- Building trust through consistency

#### 6. **Transformative Justice**
We seek to transform the conditions that create harm rather than simply punishing those who cause it. We build toward healing and prevention.

**What this means:**
- Addressing root causes, not just symptoms
- Creating accountability with compassion
- Building systems that prevent harm
- Centering those most impacted

#### 7. **Collective Liberation**
We work toward the freedom of all people and the planet. Our struggles are interconnected, and our liberation must be collective.

**What this means:**
- Centering the most marginalized
- Building solidarity across movements
- Rejecting solutions that liberate some at the expense of others
- Creating abundance for all

#### 8. **Joy and Pleasure**
We believe that justice work should feed our spirits. The world we're building should be one we want to live in, starting now.

**What this means:**
- Making our work sustainable
- Celebrating victories along the way
- Building beauty into our solutions
- Practicing collective care

#### 9. **Abundance Mindset**
We operate from a belief that there is enough for everyone when we share. Scarcity is often manufactured; abundance can be cultivated.

**What this means:**
- Sharing resources generously
- Building commons over enclosures
- Creating regenerative systems
- Trusting in collective provision

#### 10. **Radical Imagination**
We dare to envision worlds that don't yet exist and work to bring them into being. What we can imagine, we can create.

**What this means:**
- Thinking beyond current limitations
- Creating new possibilities
- Rejecting "that's how it's always been"
- Building the future in the present

#### 11. **Cooperation Over Competition**
We choose collaboration, mutual support, and collective success over rivalry, scarcity-based thinking, and zero-sum games. Together we accomplish what none could alone.

**What this means:**
- Sharing knowledge, code, and resources freely
- Celebrating others' successes as our own
- Building on each other's work with attribution and gratitude
- Creating systems that reward collaboration
- Refusing to see other projects as competitors
- Designing for interoperability and mutual benefit

### Living These Values

#### In Our Technology
- **Systems that strengthen community bonds** rather than replace them
- **Tools that adapt to people** rather than forcing people to adapt
- **Architectures that distribute power** rather than concentrate it
- **Designs that bring joy** rather than mere functionality
- **Commons-based approaches** rather than proprietary lock-in
- **Protocols that enable cooperation** rather than enforce competition
- **Interoperable standards** rather than walled gardens
- **Shared infrastructure** rather than duplicated efforts

#### In Our Process
- **Starting with those most affected** by the problems we're solving
- **Building with, not for** communities
- **Sharing knowledge freely** and building capacity everywhere
- **Celebrating small wins** while working toward transformation
- **Practicing the future** we want to create

#### In Our Relationships
- **Assuming good intentions** while addressing impact
- **Making space for multiple truths** and experiences
- **Building slowly to build well** with deep roots
- **Caring for each other** as part of the work
- **Learning from failure** without shame

### Value Tensions and Navigation

Sometimes values seem to conflict. When they do:

1. **Return to those most impacted** - Center their needs and wisdom
2. **Look for creative solutions** - Can both/and replace either/or?
3. **Consider timeframes** - What serves immediate needs vs. long-term transformation?
4. **Practice transparency** - Name the tension and decide collectively
5. **Document learnings** - Share wisdom for others facing similar tensions

### Measuring Alignment

We know we're living these values when:
- Communities have more control over their lives
- People feel more connected, not more isolated
- Joy and sustainability increase in our movements
- Power becomes more distributed over time
- New leaders and possibilities keep emerging
- Harm decreases and healing increases
- More people can imagine and build new futures

### Relationship to Principles

These values inform our principles but are distinct:
- **Values**: What we believe and what we're building toward
- **Principles**: How we operationalize those values in our work

Our principles should always trace back to these core values. When they don't, we need to revisit and realign.
