## Content

### From Interdependence

#### Principle: Design for Mutual Benefit
**Operational Guidance:**
- Every feature should strengthen at least one relationship
- Success metrics must include collective outcomes
- Individual gains should create positive externalities
- No zero-sum game mechanics in any system

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Does this strengthen connections between users?
- [ ] Are benefits shared rather than hoarded?
- [ ] Do individual actions improve collective conditions?
- [ ] Have we eliminated competitive dynamics?

#### Principle: Build Feedback Loops of Care
**Operational Guidance:**

**Implementation Examples:**
- Contribution tracking that highlights helping others
- Dashboards showing community health metrics
