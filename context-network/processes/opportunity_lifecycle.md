## Content

### Overview

The opportunity lifecycle follows a natural emergence path where each stage builds upon and refines the previous:

```
VALUES → PRINCIPLES → OPPORTUNITIES → OPTIONS → DESIGNS → IMPLEMENTATIONS → COORDINATION
```

This is a values-driven process where core beliefs shape principles, which guide the identification of opportunities through various methods, leading to concrete implementations that serve communities.

Each transition point represents a key area where effort can be applied to advance opportunities through the lifecycle.

3. **Blockers:** What's preventing progress to next stage
4. **Required Effort:** What type of effort would advance it
5. **Community Engagement:** Level of community involvement
