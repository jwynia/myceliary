### Research Execution Requirements

#### MCP Tool Usage (REQUIRED)
All research tasks MUST be executed using appropriate MCP tools:

- Basic Web Search: Use Research MCP basicWebSearch tool
- Light Research Report: Use Research MCP lightResearchReport tool
- Standard Research Report: Use Research MCP mediumResearchReport tool
- Deep Research Report: Use Research MCP deepResearchReport tool
- URL Content Capture: Use Research MCP captureUrlContent tool
- Archive Search: Use Research MCP searchLocalArchives tool

**Critical Rule:** "Ambient" knowledge or direct web browsing MUST NOT be used as substitutes for MCP tools. This ensures:
- Consistent research methodology
- Traceable information sources
- Reproducible results
- Proper archiving of findings

**Key Finding from Practice:** Experience has demonstrated that using MCP tools REDUCES overhead compared to relying on ambient knowledge. While ambient knowledge often leads to circular reasoning and ungrounded exploration, MCP tools provide:
- Concrete starting points for research
- Verified external information to ground decisions
- Clear paths forward when stuck
- Efficient ways to validate or challenge assumptions

### Research Task Management

#### Task Index Maintenance
The research tasks index (research_tasks/research_tasks_index.md) MUST be kept up to date:

**When Creating New Tasks:**
1. Create task file using task_template.md
2. Add task to appropriate section in research_tasks_index.md
3. Update status distribution counts
4. Update priority distribution counts
5. Add any new task relationships to the mermaid diagram
6. Update metadata and change history

**When Updating Tasks:**
1. Update task status in index when task status changes
2. Update next run/due dates for recurring tasks
3. Update last updated date and metadata
4. Adjust relationships if task dependencies change
5. Recalculate status and priority distributions

**When Completing Tasks:**
1. Mark task as completed in index
2. Clear next run date (use "-")
3. Update status distribution counts
4. Document completion in change history
5. Ensure findings are properly linked in analysis/findings/

**Monthly Index Review:**
1. Verify all tasks are properly indexed
2. Update status of overdue tasks
3. Review and update task relationships
4. Clean up completed one-time tasks
5. Plan new tasks based on gaps identified

### Research Process Notes

**Source Prioritization:**
1. Community organizations and practitioners
2. Critical academic research
3. Movement publications and alternative media
4. Government and policy sources (with critical analysis)
5. Corporate sources (for understanding threats and co-optation)

**Geographic Balance:**
- Ensure representation from Global South perspectives
- Include indigenous and decolonial frameworks
- Balance urban and rural contexts
- Consider different political and economic systems

**Temporal Considerations:**
- Track evolution of ideas and implementations over time
- Monitor both successes and failures
- Document changing political and economic contexts
- Note seasonal patterns in organizing and development

**Quality Assessment:**
- Prioritize sources that center affected communities
- Seek diverse perspectives within anti-capitalist frameworks
- Verify claims through multiple sources
- Document conflicts and contradictions in findings
