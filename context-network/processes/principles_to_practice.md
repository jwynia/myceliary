### Architecture Decisions

#### When Designing System Architecture

**Primary Principles:**
- Distribute by Design
- Design for Evolution
- Default to Distribution
- Replicate Knowledge and Power

**Concrete Practices:**

1. **Start with Federation**
   ```
   ❌ DON'T: Build centralized first, federate later
   ✅ DO: Design federation protocol from day one
   
   Example Structure:
   - Each community runs their own node
   - Nodes can operate independently
   - Optional coordination layer
   - Data sovereignty by default
   ```

2. **Version Everything**
   ```
   ❌ DON'T: Assume current structure is final
   ✅ DO: Build migration paths into v1
   
   Required Components:
   - Schema versioning
   - Data migration tools
   - Compatibility layers
   - Clear deprecation paths
   ```

3. **Document Architecture Decisions**
   ```
   Template for ADRs (Architecture Decision Records):
   - Which values/principles does this serve?
   - What alternatives were considered?
   - How does this distribute power?
   - What are the evolution paths?
   ```

### Interface Design

#### When Creating User Interfaces

**Primary Principles:**
- Build Beauty
- Design for Mutual Benefit
- Transparency Over Complexity
- Intersectional by Design

**Concrete Practices:**

1. **Beauty as Resistance**
   ```css
   /* ❌ DON'T: Purely functional brutalism */
   .button { background: #ccc; }
   
   /* ✅ DO: Thoughtful, delightful design */
   .button { 
     background: var(--joy-gradient);
     transition: all 0.3s ease;
     /* Include cultural aesthetic options */
   }
   ```

2. **Show Mutual Impact**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ DON'T: Hide collective effects
   updateUserStats(userId, action);
   
   // ✅ DO: Surface mutual benefit
   const impact = updateUserStats(userId, action);
   showCommunityBenefit(impact);
   celebrateCollectiveWin(impact);
   ```

3. **Accessibility First**
   ```
   Development Order:
   1. Screen reader compatible version
   2. Keyboard-only navigation  
   3. High contrast mode
   4. Multiple language support
   5. THEN visual enhancements
   ```

### Data Design

#### When Structuring Data

**Primary Principles:**
- Design for Evolution
- Share By Default
- Nothing About Us Without Us
- Local-first, Network-enhanced

**Concrete Practices:**

1. **User-Controlled Schemas**
   ```json
   // ❌ DON'T: Fixed schemas imposed
   {
     "user": {
       "name": "string",
       "email": "string"
     }
   }
   
   // ✅ DO: Extensible, community-defined
   {
     "user": {
       "core": { /* minimal required */ },
       "community_extensions": { /* defined by community */ },
       "personal_fields": { /* user-defined */ }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Export-Ready Always**
   ```
   Every data type must support:
   - JSON export
   - CSV where applicable
   - Relationship preservation
   - Media included/referenced
   - Standard format documentation
   ```

3. **Deletion = Liberation**
   ```
   User data controls:
   - Full export on demand
   - Selective sharing toggles
   - Complete deletion capability
   - Portability to other instances
   - Clear data retention policies
   ```

### Community Features

#### When Building Social/Community Features

**Primary Principles:**
- Build Feedback Loops of Care
- Cultivate Patience
- Focus on Critical Connections
- Celebrate Collective Wins

**Concrete Practices:**

1. **Highlight Mutual Aid**
   ```
   Feature: Community Support Tracker
   - Shows who helped whom
   - Celebrates support patterns
   - Makes invisible labor visible
   - Rewards collaboration over competition
   ```

2. **Depth Over Breadth**
   ```
   ❌ DON'T: Follower counts, viral mechanics
   ✅ DO: Relationship strength indicators
   
   Metrics That Matter:
   - Mutual support instances
   - Collaboration depth
   - Collective achievements
   - Community health indicators
   ```

3. **Async-First Communication**
   ```
   Design for:
   - Different time zones
   - Varied availability  
   - Careful consideration
   - Inclusive participation
   
   Not optimizing for:
   - Instant response
   - Always-on presence
   - Reactive engagement
   ```

### Safety and Security

#### When Implementing Safety Features

**Primary Principles:**
- Design Out Harm
- Address Harm Immediately
- Accountability With Growth
- Transformative Justice

**Concrete Practices:**

1. **Prevent By Design**
   ```
   Before adding any feature, ask:
   - How could this be weaponized?
   - Who is most vulnerable?
   - What guardrails prevent abuse?
   - Can we design this differently?
   
   Example: Instead of public comments,
   use consent-based interaction
   ```

2. **Community-Led Moderation**
   ```
   Tools for communities:
   - Define their own standards
   - Choose enforcement levels
   - Create accountability processes
   - Design restoration paths
   ```

3. **Rapid Response Protocol**
   ```
   When harm is reported:
   1. Immediate safety measures
   2. Community notification
   3. Transparent process
   4. Focus on healing
   5. System improvement
   ```

### APIs and Integration

#### When Building APIs

**Primary Principles:**
- Collaborative Advantage
- Share By Default
- Design for Plenty
- Interoperability

**Concrete Practices:**

1. **Federation-First APIs**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ DON'T: Closed, authenticated-only
   GET /api/internal/data
   
   // ✅ DO: Open, federated protocol
   GET /federation/v1/public/data
   ActivityPub compatible where possible
   ```

2. **Generous Rate Limits**
   ```
   Philosophy: Assume good faith
   - High default limits
   - Increase for community projects
   - Share resources during high load
   - Collaborative defense only
   ```

3. **Documentation as Gift**
   ```
   Every endpoint includes:
   - Clear use cases
   - Example implementations
   - Common patterns
   - Integration stories
   - Community extensions
   ```

### Governance Systems

#### When Building Governance Tools

**Primary Principles:**
- Nothing About Us Without Us
- Move at Speed of Trust
- Integrity at Every Scale
- Distribute by Design

**Concrete Practices:**

1. **Configurable Governance**
   ```
   Communities can choose:
   - Decision-making methods
   - Voting mechanisms
   - Representation models
   - Accountability processes
   
   Not imposed:
   - "Best practices"
   - Default hierarchies
   - Fixed processes
   ```

2. **Transparent Process**
   ```
   All governance actions show:
   - Who participated
   - What was decided
   - Why (reasoning)
   - How to challenge
   - Learning captured
   ```

3. **Scale-Appropriate Tools**
   ```
   3 people: Simple consent tools
   30 people: Structured facilitation
   300 people: Representation options
   3000 people: Liquid democracy
   
   Each includes previous capabilities
   ```

### Common Tensions and Resolutions

#### Speed vs. Trust
**Tension:** Pressure to ship vs. community readiness
**Resolution:** Define "minimum viable trust" - smallest version that maintains relationships

#### Individual vs. Collective
**Tension:** Personal features vs. community benefit
**Resolution:** Individual features that create positive externalities

#### Simplicity vs. Power
**Tension:** Easy to use vs. community control
**Resolution:** Progressive complexity - simple defaults, powerful options

#### Innovation vs. Stability
**Tension:** New ideas vs. reliable systems
**Resolution:** Stable core, experimental edges with clear boundaries
