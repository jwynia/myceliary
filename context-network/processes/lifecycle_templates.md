### Using the Templates

#### When to Use Each Template
1. Use templates when documenting new items at each stage
2. Templates can be adapted based on specific needs
3. Not all sections may apply to every case

#### Template Evolution
- Templates should evolve based on usage experience
- Propose changes through the standard process
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

#### Cross-Stage Linking
- Always link back to previous stage documents
- Create forward links as next stages develop
- Maintain bidirectional references

## Relationships
- **Parent Nodes:** 
  - [processes/opportunity_lifecycle.md] - supports - Templates support lifecycle process
- **Child Nodes:** None
- **Related Nodes:**
  - [processes/opportunity_lifecycle_diagram.md] - complements - Visual guide to stages

## Navigation Guidance
- **Access Context:** Use when documenting opportunities at any stage
- **Common Next Steps:** 
  - Copy relevant template
  - Fill in documentation
  - Link to lifecycle tracking
- **Related Tasks:** Documentation, stage progression, status updates
