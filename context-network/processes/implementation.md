# Implementation Process

## Purpose
This document outlines the complete process for taking strategic opportunities through technical specification, design, prototyping, and production deployment while maintaining anti-capitalist principles and community control.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Overview

This process bridges the gap between strategic analysis (identifying Cannae-style opportunities) and community-controlled production systems. It ensures that implementation maintains anti-capitalist principles while serving real community needs.
