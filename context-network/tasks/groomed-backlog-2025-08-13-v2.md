# Groomed Task Backlog - 2025-08-13 (Updated)

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Create Consensus Engine Technical Specification Page
**One-liner**: Transform the comprehensive 460-line technical spec into a public-facing website page  
**Effort**: 45-60 minutes  
**Files to create**: 
- `/docs/cannae/consensus-engine.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: A complete technical specification exists for the Consensus Engine (participatory budgeting AI) at Stage 5 (Design Complete), but it's not visible on the website. This blocks community understanding of one of our most sophisticated anti-capitalist AI designs.

**Source Material Available**:
- Full 460-line specification at `/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/consensus_engine_participatory_budgeting.md`
- Contains complete architecture, data models, implementation phases
- Includes detailed anti-capitalist features and community governance

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create public-facing page from technical specification
- [ ] Adapt technical content for website audience (less code, more concept)
- [ ] Include key sections:
  - Problem space and opportunity
  - Core concept and anti-capitalist approach
  - System architecture overview
  - Key features for collective intelligence
  - Implementation phases
  - Community governance model
- [ ] Add appropriate Jekyll front matter
- [ ] Link from main Cannae index page
- [ ] Maintain consistent tone with other Cannae pages

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Read full technical spec at `/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/consensus_engine_participatory_budgeting.md`
2. Create `/docs/cannae/consensus-engine.md` with Jekyll front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: default
   title: Consensus Engine for Participatory Budgeting
   parent: "Cannae Opportunities: Exploiting Capitalist Blind Spots"
   nav_order: 5
   ---
   ```
3. Structure the page:
   - **The Opportunity** - Exploit "individual productivity obsession"
   - **Problem Space** - Current voting systems vs collective wisdom
   - **Our Solution** - Collective intelligence amplifier
   - **Core Features** - 5 key components (simplified from spec)
   - **Technical Approach** - High-level architecture
   - **Use Cases** - Participatory budgeting examples
   - **Implementation Roadmap** - 3 phases from spec
   - **Get Involved** - Community participation options
4. Extract and simplify key concepts:
   - Collective Input Synthesis (not votes)
   - Emergent Theme Discovery
   - Conflict Transformation
   - Consensus Quality Analysis
   - Collective Memory System
5. Focus on WHY over HOW (philosophy over implementation)
6. Add visual elements where helpful (use existing mermaid diagrams)
7. Test page renders correctly

**Watch Out For**: 
- Don't overwhelm with technical details - link to full spec for developers
- Keep anti-capitalist framing clear and accessible
- Explain technical concepts in plain language
- Maintain hope and possibility (not just critique)
- Ensure consistency with bureaucracy-navigation.md tone

**Key Messages to Convey**:
- Consensus is more than voting
- Collective wisdom emerges from good process
- AI can amplify group intelligence, not just individual productivity
- Communities can govern their own decision processes
- This challenges capitalism's individualist assumptions

### 2. Create Craft Augmentation AI Specification
**One-liner**: Document AI tools that enhance human craft rather than replacing workers  
**Effort**: 60-90 minutes  
**Files to create**: 
- `/docs/cannae/craft-augmentation.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Craft Augmentation AI is at Stage 5 (Design Complete) and represents our anti-automation philosophy - AI that enhances human skill rather than replacing humans. No detailed spec exists yet, but the concept is crucial for demonstrating alternatives to capitalist automation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create comprehensive page explaining craft augmentation
- [ ] Contrast clearly with automation/replacement
- [ ] Include concrete examples across craft domains
- [ ] Explain technical approach to augmentation
- [ ] Show how this preserves and enhances human skills
- [ ] Add implementation patterns
- [ ] Link from Cannae index

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Search context network for craft augmentation references
2. Create page structure following Cannae pattern
3. Key sections to include:
   - The anti-automation opportunity
   - Problem with capitalist automation
   - Augmentation philosophy
   - Example domains (woodworking, textiles, cooking, arts)
   - Technical patterns for augmentation
   - Community benefits
   - Implementation approach
4. Emphasize human agency and skill development
5. Include sustainability and tradition preservation angles

**Watch Out For**: 
- Must clearly differentiate from automation
- Avoid techno-solutionism
- Respect traditional craft knowledge
- Show how AI serves craftspeople, not capital

</details>

### 3. Create Community Resilience Mesh Specification
**One-liner**: Document mesh networks for community crisis response and mutual aid  
**Effort**: 60-90 minutes  
**Files to create**: 
- `/docs/cannae/community-resilience-mesh.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Community Resilience Mesh is at Stage 3 (Options in Progress) but represents critical infrastructure for community self-determination. Mesh networks enable communication and coordination independent of corporate/state infrastructure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Explain mesh network concept for general audience
- [ ] Connect to mutual aid and crisis response
- [ ] Show how this challenges infrastructure monopolies
- [ ] Include technical architecture overview
- [ ] Provide implementation examples
- [ ] Address community governance

**Note**: This is slightly blocked by "Options in Progress" status, but we can create preliminary documentation based on general mesh network patterns and community needs.

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Minor Prep Needed)

### Add Technical Specifications Index
**Blocker**: Need to complete 2-3 individual spec pages first  
**Estimated unblock**: After consensus-engine and craft-augmentation pages  
**Prep work possible**: Plan index structure and navigation

### Enhance Cannae Index with Progress Indicators
**Blocker**: Need all spec pages created first  
**Estimated unblock**: After technical specifications complete  
**Prep work possible**: Design progress indicator format

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Visualization Components Priority
**Decision needed**: Should we prioritize interactive visualizations or focus on content first?  
**Options**: 
- Content-first: Complete all specs, then add visuals
- Visual-enhanced: Add diagrams/charts with each spec
**Recommendation**: Content-first for faster value delivery

### Technical Specification Depth
**Decision needed**: How technical should public-facing specs be?  
**Options**:
- High-level only (link to detailed specs)
- Medium detail (some architecture, no code)
- Full technical (include data models, algorithms)
**Recommendation**: Medium detail with links to full specs

## üóëÔ∏è Completed Tasks

### Enhance Research Archives Display
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed in 37 minutes
- **Result**: Added 12 medium reports and 1 deep report
- **Impact**: 210% content increase, all research now visible

## Summary Statistics
- Total tasks reviewed: 5
- Ready for work: 3
- Completed today: 1
- Blocked/waiting: 2
- Time saved: 23 minutes on research archives (vs estimate)

## Top 3 Recommendations

1. **Create Consensus Engine Page** (45-60 min)
   - Highest value: Showcases sophisticated anti-capitalist AI design
   - Source material ready: Full 460-line spec available
   - Clear implementation path

2. **Create Craft Augmentation Page** (60-90 min)
   - Philosophical importance: Anti-automation stance
   - Broad appeal: Relevant to many communities
   - Differentiator: Unique approach to AI

3. **Update Cannae Index** (15 min)
   - Quick win: Add links to new pages
   - Improve navigation: Users can find new content
   - Show progress: Demonstrate active development

## Implementation Strategy

**Recommended Session Plan (3-4 hours)**:
1. Start with Consensus Engine (highest value, clearest path)
2. Then Craft Augmentation (build on momentum)
3. Quick Cannae index update
4. If time: Begin Community Resilience Mesh

**Why This Order**:
- Consensus Engine has complete source material (lowest friction)
- Establishes pattern for other specs
- Shows sophisticated technical work
- Craft Augmentation provides philosophical balance
- Both can be completed in one focused session
