# Task: Add Visualization Components for Progress Tracking

## Priority: Medium

## Source
- Generated from website sync report 2025-08-13
- Original recommendation: Add missing visualizations from context network

## Description
Create visualization components to display pipeline tracking, progress metrics, and relationship diagrams on the website.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create stage distribution chart component
- [ ] Add opportunity pipeline visualization
- [ ] Create research task progress dashboard
- [ ] Add implementation tracker with visual indicators
- [ ] Include source method breakdown chart
- [ ] Add effort application matrix
- [ ] Create task relationship diagram
- [ ] Ensure mobile-responsive design

## Technical Considerations
- Must work within Jekyll/GitHub Pages constraints
- Consider using Mermaid.js (already in use)
- May need custom CSS/JS components
- Should gracefully degrade without JavaScript

## Source Materials
- `/context-network/processes/opportunity_tracker.md` (pipeline data)
- Research task relationships from context network
- Implementation stages from tracker

## Effort Estimate: Large (4-6 hours)

## Risk Level: Medium
- Requires frontend development
- Jekyll plugin constraints
- Cross-browser compatibility needed
- Performance considerations

## Dependencies
- Understanding of Jekyll's capabilities
- May need to research visualization libraries
- Requires design decisions

## Why Deferred
- Complex frontend development task
- Needs design planning
- Requires testing across browsers
- May need multiple iterations
- Performance optimization needed
