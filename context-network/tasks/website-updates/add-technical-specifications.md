# Task: Add Missing Technical Specification Pages

## Priority: High

## Source
- Generated from website sync report 2025-08-13
- Original recommendation: 7 technical specifications at Stage 5 need pages

## Description
Create detailed technical specification pages for Cannae opportunities that have completed designs but lack website documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `docs/cannae/consensus-engine.md` with full technical spec
- [ ] Create `docs/cannae/craft-augmentation.md` with full technical spec
- [ ] Create `docs/cannae/community-resilience-mesh.md` with full technical spec
- [ ] Create `docs/cannae/bureaucracy-navigation.md` with full technical spec
- [ ] Update existing pages with more detailed technical specifications:
  - [ ] `liberation-software.md`
  - [ ] `portable-identity.md`
  - [ ] `careful-ai-development.md`
  - [ ] `hyperlocal-ai.md`
- [ ] Add cross-references between specs and main Cannae index
- [ ] Include implementation readiness indicators

## Source Materials
- `/context-network/processes/opportunity_tracker.md`
- `/context-network/analysis/specifications/`
- Technical specs from context network tasks

## Effort Estimate: Large (3-4 hours)

## Risk Level: Low
- Content creation only
- No technical changes
- Enhances existing structure

## Dependencies
- Need to locate all technical specifications in context network
- Requires synthesis of multiple source documents
- Should maintain consistent format across all specs

## Why Deferred
- Multiple pages to create
- Requires deep dive into technical specifications
- Needs consistent formatting approach
- Content synthesis from multiple sources
