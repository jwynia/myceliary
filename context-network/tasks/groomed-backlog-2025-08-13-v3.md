# Groomed Task Backlog - 2025-08-13 (v3)

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Create Craft Augmentation AI Page
**One-liner**: Transform 390-line anti-automation technical spec into accessible website documentation  
**Effort**: 45-60 minutes  
**Files to create**: 
- `/docs/cannae/craft-augmentation.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: A complete 390-line technical specification exists for Craft Augmentation AI at Stage 5 (Design Complete). This represents our anti-automation philosophy‚ÄîAI that enhances human skill rather than replacing workers. This is crucial for demonstrating alternatives to capitalist automation.

**Source Material Available**:
- Full specification at `/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/craft_augmentation_ai.md`
- Exploits "Automation Absolutism" mental model
- Contains "Intelligent Apprentice System" architecture
- Includes craft domains: woodworking, textiles, cooking, metalwork, pottery, music

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create public-facing page from technical specification
- [ ] Clearly contrast augmentation vs automation
- [ ] Include concrete examples from spec (5 craft domains)
- [ ] Explain "Intelligent Apprentice" concept
- [ ] Show how this preserves human skills and livelihoods
- [ ] Add implementation patterns from spec
- [ ] Include community governance aspects
- [ ] Link from Cannae index (augmentation-not-automation.md)

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Read full spec at `/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/craft_augmentation_ai.md`
2. Create `/docs/cannae/craft-augmentation.md` with Jekyll front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: default
   title: Craft Augmentation AI
   parent: "Cannae Opportunities: Exploiting Capitalist Blind Spots"
   nav_order: 10
   ---
   ```
3. Structure the page using spec's framework:
   - **The Opportunity** - Exploit "Automation Absolutism"
   - **Problem Space** - Automation killing craft vs augmentation preserving it
   - **Our Solution** - Intelligent Apprentice System
   - **Core Principles** - From spec: Preserve Agency, Enhance Not Replace, etc.
   - **Craft Domains** - 5 examples from spec with specific augmentations
   - **Technical Approach** - Simplified architecture
   - **Implementation Examples** - Real scenarios
   - **Get Involved** - Craftspeople, developers, communities
4. Key concepts to emphasize from spec:
   - Human-Centered Task Analyzer
   - Joy and satisfaction detection
   - Skill preservation algorithms
   - Economic sustainability features
   - Craft knowledge commons
5. Use concrete examples from spec:
   - Woodworking: grain analysis, joint optimization
   - Textiles: pattern generation, tension monitoring
   - Cooking: flavor pairing, timing coordination
   - Metalwork: heat management, stress analysis
   - Pottery: form suggestions, glaze chemistry
6. Include quotes about preserving craft joy and meaning

**Watch Out For**: 
- Don't make it sound like "AI helpers" that still replace workers
- Emphasize human control and agency throughout
- Show economic benefits for craftspeople, not just consumers
- Avoid techno-solutionism - respect traditional knowledge
- Make clear this is NOT about making craft "more efficient"

**Key Messages from Spec**:
- "Preserving the joy, meaning, and livelihood of craft work"
- "AI that acts as an intelligent apprentice"
- "Human judgment central rather than peripheral"
- "Amplifying rather than replacing human skill"
- "Maintaining craft as meaningful work"

### 2. Update Augmentation-Not-Automation Page
**One-liner**: Add link to new Craft Augmentation spec from existing overview page  
**Effort**: 10-15 minutes  
**Files to modify**: 
- `/docs/cannae/augmentation-not-automation.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: The augmentation-not-automation.md page already exists as an overview. Once the Craft Augmentation spec page is created, we should link them together.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add section about Craft Augmentation implementation
- [ ] Link to new craft-augmentation.md page
- [ ] Ensure consistent messaging between pages
- [ ] Update any outdated information

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Open `/docs/cannae/augmentation-not-automation.md`
2. Add a new section near the bottom:
   ```markdown
   ## Specific Implementation: Craft Augmentation AI
   
   We've developed a complete technical specification for AI that enhances 
   traditional crafts without replacing craftspeople. 
   [Learn more about Craft Augmentation AI ‚Üí](craft-augmentation)
   ```
3. Review page for consistency with new spec

</details>

### 3. Create Community Resilience Mesh Page
**One-liner**: Document mesh networks for crisis response and mutual aid coordination  
**Effort**: 60-90 minutes  
**Files to create**: 
- `/docs/cannae/community-resilience-mesh.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Community Resilience Mesh is at Stage 3 (Options in Progress) but represents critical infrastructure for community self-determination. While no full spec exists yet, the concept is well-defined in the opportunity tracker.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Explain mesh networks in accessible terms
- [ ] Connect to mutual aid and crisis response
- [ ] Show infrastructure independence benefits
- [ ] Include real-world examples (disaster response)
- [ ] Add basic technical architecture
- [ ] Address community governance needs
- [ ] Acknowledge "Options in Progress" status

**Note**: This task has less source material than the others, requiring more creative synthesis from general mesh network knowledge and community needs.

## ‚è≥ Recently Completed

### ‚úÖ Consensus Engine Page - DONE
- Completed in 35 minutes
- Transformed 460-line spec successfully
- Added to collective-intelligence.md

### ‚úÖ Research Archives Enhancement - DONE
- Completed in 37 minutes  
- Added 12 medium reports + 1 deep report
- Page expanded by 210%

## üìä Summary Statistics
- Tasks ready: 3
- Completed today: 2
- Total time saved: 33 minutes (vs estimates)
- Success rate: 100%

## üéØ Top Recommendation

**Do Craft Augmentation Next** - Here's why:
1. **Complete source material exists** (390-line spec ready)
2. **High philosophical value** (anti-automation stance)
3. **Concrete examples available** (5 craft domains detailed)
4. **Manageable scope** (45-60 minutes like Consensus Engine)
5. **Continues momentum** from successful implementations

## Session Strategy

If continuing work session:
1. **Craft Augmentation Page** (45-60 min) - Main implementation
2. **Update Augmentation Overview** (10-15 min) - Quick link addition
3. **Break** - Rest before next major task
4. **Community Resilience Mesh** (60-90 min) - If energy remains

Total estimate: 2-3 hours for all three tasks

*Next best task: Create Craft Augmentation AI page - leverage existing 390-line specification to showcase our anti-automation philosophy with concrete craft examples.*
