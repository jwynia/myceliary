# Task: Create Cannae Technical Specifications

## Task Overview
Created technical specifications for three remaining Cannae opportunities that exploit specific capitalist mental model vulnerabilities.

## Status: COMPLETED

## Specifications Created

### 1. Careful AI Development for Elder Care
- **File**: `/workspaces/myceliary/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/careful_ai_development_elder_care.md`
- **Exploits**: "Innovation Speed Cult" - Move fast and break things mentality
- **Key Innovation**: Community veto power, mandatory slow deployment, elder-led development
- **Unique Features**:
  - 30-day minimum review periods
  - Multi-stage testing with community pause points
  - Elder councils with absolute veto power
  - Success measured by dignity and trust, not speed

### 2. Hyperlocal AI for Food Security  
- **File**: `/workspaces/myceliary/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/hyperlocal_ai_food_security.md`
- **Exploits**: "Scale-or-Die Mentality" - If it doesn't scale globally, it's worthless
- **Key Innovation**: Intentionally unscalable, neighborhood-bounded AI systems
- **Unique Features**:
  - Hard geographical boundaries (walkable distance)
  - Hyperlocal knowledge (specific soil, microclimates)
  - Federation as pattern sharing, not data aggregation
  - Success measured by local food security, not scale

### 3. Craft Augmentation AI
- **File**: `/workspaces/myceliary/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/craft_augmentation_ai.md`
- **Exploits**: "Automation Absolutism" - Automate everything possible
- **Key Innovation**: AI that explicitly preserves human craft and judgment
- **Unique Features**:
  - Task analysis prioritizing joy and meaning
  - Intelligent apprentice model (assists, doesn't replace)
  - Craft knowledge preservation without commodification
  - Success measured by craft preservation and livelihood

## Implementation Details

Each specification follows the established template with:
- Strategic foundation showing how it exploits capitalist vulnerabilities
- Detailed system architecture with anti-capitalist features
- Community governance integration throughout
- Technical requirements that prioritize community needs
- Implementation phases respecting community pace
- Success metrics beyond efficiency and profit

## Key Themes Across Specifications

1. **Temporal Resistance**: Using time differently than capitalism expects
   - Elder care: Radically slow deployment
   - Food security: Seasonal rhythms
   - Craft: Craft-paced development

2. **Scale Subversion**: Rejecting growth imperatives
   - Elder care: Community-sized deployments
   - Food security: Neighborhood boundaries
   - Craft: Individual to small cooperative

3. **Value Redefinition**: Success beyond efficiency
   - Elder care: Dignity and trust
   - Food security: Local resilience
   - Craft: Joy and livelihood

## Updates Made
- Created three comprehensive technical specifications
- Updated implementation index with all new specifications
- Maintained consistency with existing specification format

## Relationships
- **Source**: [Cannae AI Opportunities](../../analysis/findings/cannae_ai_opportunities.md)
- **Output**: Three technical specifications in implementations directory
- **Related**: Anti-capitalist framework, Implementation patterns
