# Groomed Task Backlog - 2025-08-13 (v4)

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Create Craft Augmentation AI Page (WITH WORKER CONTROL EMPHASIS)
**One-liner**: Transform technical spec into documentation that centers worker control over what gets augmented  
**Effort**: 45-60 minutes  
**Files to create**: 
- `/docs/cannae/craft-augmentation.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Core Principle to Emphasize**: 
> "The difference between augmentation and automation is WHO CONTROLS what gets augmented. When workers choose what to augment to free up time/skill/energy for things they'd rather do or are better at - that's augmentation. When it's used to cut out people who want to be doing the work - that's automation."

**Context**: A complete 390-line technical specification exists for Craft Augmentation AI. This represents our worker-controlled enhancement philosophy‚ÄîAI that workers control to enhance their craft, not AI imposed to replace them.

**Source Material Available**:
- Full specification at `/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/craft_augmentation_ai.md`
- Key insight: Worker agency and control is THE differentiator

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] **CENTRAL THEME**: Worker control over augmentation choices
- [ ] Show how workers decide what to augment vs what to keep manual
- [ ] Contrast with top-down automation imposed by management
- [ ] Include examples of workers choosing to augment tedious tasks
- [ ] Show how this preserves meaningful work workers WANT to do
- [ ] Explain governance structures that keep control with workers
- [ ] Include "joy and satisfaction detection" from spec
- [ ] Show economic benefits flowing to workers, not just owners

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Read full spec at `/context-network/analysis/implementations/technical_specifications/craft_augmentation_ai.md`
2. Create `/docs/cannae/craft-augmentation.md` with Jekyll front matter
3. **Lead with Worker Control**:
   ```markdown
   ## Who Decides What Gets Augmented?
   
   The fundamental difference between our approach and capitalist automation:
   - **Augmentation**: Workers choose what tasks to enhance or delegate
   - **Automation**: Management imposes technology to eliminate workers
   
   When a woodworker decides they want help analyzing grain patterns 
   but keeps hand-carving because they love it - that's augmentation.
   When a factory owner buys CNC machines to fire woodworkers - that's automation.
   ```

4. Structure sections around control and agency:
   - **Worker-Controlled Enhancement** (not "AI Features")
   - **Preserving What Workers Love** (not "Efficiency Gains")
   - **Freeing Energy for Creativity** (not "Cost Reduction")
   - **Community Governance** (not "Management Systems")

5. Use concrete control examples from spec:
   - Woodworker chooses grain analysis but keeps joinery manual
   - Potter wants glaze chemistry help but shapes clay by hand
   - Cook augments timing coordination but keeps flavor decisions
   - Textile artist uses pattern generation for ideas but weaves manually
   - Metalworker gets heat management help but hammers themselves

6. Include "Task Choice Framework":
   ```
   Workers ask themselves:
   - What parts of my craft bring me joy?
   - What tasks are tedious but necessary?
   - Where would help let me focus on what I do best?
   - What must stay in my hands to remain meaningful?
   ```

7. Emphasize economic control:
   - Workers own the augmentation tools
   - Benefits flow to those doing the work
   - No vendor lock-in or platform dependency
   - Community-controlled development

**Key Messages to Weave Throughout**:
- "You choose what to augment, not your boss"
- "Free your energy for the work you love"
- "Enhance your best skills, delegate the tedious"
- "Technology that respects your expertise"
- "AI that knows who's in charge - you"

**Contrast Examples**:
- ‚ùå Automation: "This AI will make craftspeople obsolete"
- ‚úÖ Augmentation: "This AI helps craftspeople focus on what they do best"

- ‚ùå Automation: "Reduce labor costs by 80%"
- ‚úÖ Augmentation: "Free up 80% more time for creative work"

- ‚ùå Automation: "Standardize output across all workers"
- ‚úÖ Augmentation: "Enhance each craftsperson's unique style"

**Watch Out For**: 
- Don't fall into "efficiency" framing - it's about control and joy
- Avoid "AI democratization" language that ignores power dynamics
- Be explicit that workers, not owners, control the technology
- Show this isn't about making workers "more productive" for bosses

### 2. Update Augmentation-Not-Automation Page with Control Principle
**One-liner**: Add worker control as the key differentiator to existing overview  
**Effort**: 15-20 minutes  
**Files to modify**: 
- `/docs/cannae/augmentation-not-automation.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: The overview page exists but should emphasize that worker control is the key differentiator between augmentation and automation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add section explaining control as key differentiator
- [ ] Update examples to show worker choice
- [ ] Link to new craft-augmentation.md page
- [ ] Ensure consistent worker-control messaging

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Add new section near the top:
   ```markdown
   ## The Key Difference: Who's In Control?
   
   Augmentation vs automation isn't about the technology - it's about power.
   
   **Augmentation happens when:**
   - Workers choose what tasks to enhance
   - People doing the work decide what helps them
   - Technology frees up time for preferred tasks
   - Benefits flow to those using the tools
   
   **Automation happens when:**
   - Management imposes technology on workers
   - Decisions made by those seeking to cut costs
   - Technology replaces people who want to work
   - Benefits flow to owners, not workers
   ```

2. Update existing examples to emphasize choice:
   - "Woodworkers choosing grain analysis" not "AI analyzing grain"
   - "Weavers requesting pattern help" not "AI generating patterns"

3. Add link to detailed spec:
   ```markdown
   ## Specific Implementation: Worker-Controlled Craft AI
   
   We've developed a complete specification for AI that workers control
   to enhance their craft on their terms.
   [Learn how workers stay in control ‚Üí](craft-augmentation)
   ```

## üìä Summary Statistics
- Tasks ready: 2 (both emphasizing worker control)
- Estimated time: 60-80 minutes total
- Key principle: Worker agency and control

## üéØ Top Recommendation

**Create the Craft Augmentation page with worker control as the central theme** because:
1. You've identified the crucial differentiator (who controls the augmentation)
2. This framing makes the anti-capitalist stance concrete and relatable
3. It directly addresses worker concerns about AI replacing them
4. The spec already has the material - just needs this framing
5. This principle applies across all Myceliary work

*The key insight: It's not about the technology, it's about who controls it and for whose benefit.*
