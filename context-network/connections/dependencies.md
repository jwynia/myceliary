### Core Framework Relationships

#### Project Definition → Analysis Frameworks
- **Relationship Type:** implements
- **Direction:** foundation/project_definition.md → analysis/frameworks/*
- **Description:** The project definition establishes the core vision and goals that the analysis frameworks implement through specific methodologies and tools.
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - Anti-capitalist framework implements core project vision for identifying liberatory AI applications
  - Capitalist trap detector implements project goal of avoiding co-optation
  - Research process implements project commitment to ongoing learning and adaptation

#### Anti-Capitalist Framework ↔ Capitalist Trap Detector
- **Relationship Type:** complements
- **Direction:** Bidirectional
- **Description:** These frameworks work together to both identify positive opportunities and avoid potential pitfalls.
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - Anti-capitalist framework identifies opportunities that trap detector helps validate
  - Trap detector findings inform refinement of anti-capitalist framework
  - Both frameworks share common theoretical foundations and principles

#### Research Process → Analysis Frameworks
- **Relationship Type:** supports
- **Direction:** processes/research.md → analysis/frameworks/*
- **Description:** The research process provides methodological support for applying and refining both analysis frameworks.
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - Research queries inform opportunity identification in anti-capitalist framework
  - Research methodology supports trap detection and validation
  - Ongoing monitoring enables framework evolution and refinement

### Process Integration Points

#### Research → Analysis
- **Relationship Type:** relates-to
- **Direction:** processes/research.md → processes/analysis.md
- **Description:** Research findings feed into analysis processes for evaluation and synthesis.
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - Research categories align with analysis needs
  - Analysis methods incorporate research outputs
  - Both processes share common evaluation criteria

#### Analysis → Synthesis
- **Relationship Type:** relates-to
- **Direction:** processes/analysis.md → processes/synthesis.md
- **Description:** Analysis outputs are synthesized into actionable insights and framework improvements.
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - Analysis patterns inform synthesis priorities
  - Synthesis methods build on analysis findings
  - Both processes contribute to framework evolution

### Framework Evolution Dependencies

#### Temporal Dependencies
- Research findings → Framework updates
- Implementation experiences → Trap detection refinement
- Community feedback → Process adaptation

#### Knowledge Flow
- Research → Analysis → Synthesis → Framework Refinement
- Practice → Documentation → Pattern Recognition → Theory Development
- Community Input → Validation → Integration → Evolution
