# Decision: Mandatory MCP Tool Usage for Research Tasks

## Purpose
Document the decision to require MCP tool usage for all research tasks, based on empirical evidence of improved efficiency and quality.

## Classification

- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Research tasks could potentially be completed using "ambient" knowledge or direct web browsing. However, empirical evidence has shown that relying on ambient knowledge leads to:
- Circular reasoning
- Ungrounded assumptions
- Inefficient exploration paths
- Difficulty validating information
- Inconsistent research quality

### Decision
All research tasks MUST be executed using appropriate MCP tools rather than relying on ambient knowledge or direct web browsing.

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Increased research efficiency by avoiding circular reasoning and ungrounded assumptions
- Consistent research methodology with clear starting points
- Traceable information sources for validation and review
- Reproducible results through standardized tools
- Proper archiving of findings for future reference
- Quality control through tool validation
- Reduced time spent on unfocused exploration
- More reliable foundation for decision-making
- Clearer distinction between verified information and speculation

#### Negative
- Learning curve for new team members
- Potential delays if tools are unavailable

### Key Insight from Practice
Experience has demonstrated that using MCP tools actually REDUCES overhead compared to relying on ambient knowledge. While ambient knowledge often leads to circular reasoning and ungrounded exploration, MCP tools provide:
- Concrete starting points for research
- Verified external information to ground decisions
- Clear paths forward when stuck
- Efficient ways to validate or challenge assumptions

This finding contradicts initial concerns about tool usage creating overhead, and instead shows that structured tool usage is more efficient than relying on ambient knowledge.

### Implementation
1. Update research process documentation to require MCP tool usage
2. Modify research task template to include tool requirements section
3. Add validation steps to quality control process
4. Train team members on MCP tool usage
5. Document tool usage patterns and efficiency gains
