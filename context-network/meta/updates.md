## Context Network Update: Framework Integration - 2025-06-05

### Information Nodes Created
- [analysis/frameworks/second_order_effects_framework.md]: Created new framework
  - **Content Changes**: Integrated comprehensive framework for analyzing AI's second-order effects
  - **Classification Changes**: Set as Semi-stable conceptual framework
  - **Structure Changes**: Organized into core premise, effects analysis, and implementation strategy

- [planning/high_leverage_projects.md]: Created new project framework
  - **Content Changes**: Established detailed framework for high-leverage community technology projects
  - **Classification Changes**: Set as Dynamic structural framework
  - **Structure Changes**: Organized into libraries, SDKs, hosted applications, and implementation priorities

### New Relationships Established
- [analysis/frameworks/second_order_effects_framework.md] → relates-to → [analysis/frameworks/anti_capitalist_framework.md]
- [analysis/frameworks/second_order_effects_framework.md] → relates-to → [analysis/frameworks/capitalist_trap_detector.md]
- [planning/high_leverage_projects.md] → implements → [analysis/frameworks/second_order_effects_framework.md]
- [planning/high_leverage_projects.md] → relates-to → [planning/roadmap.md]
- [planning/high_leverage_projects.md] → relates-to → [planning/milestones.md]

### Navigation Implications
- Second-order effects framework provides strategic context for project planning
- High-leverage projects framework offers concrete implementation guidance
- Clear connection between strategic analysis and practical implementation
- Integration with existing anti-capitalist analysis tools

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Begin detailed planning of Phase 1 foundation projects
- Create specific implementation plans for priority libraries and SDKs
- Review milestones alignment with new implementation priorities
- Consider creating project templates based on framework guidance
