### Update Log

#### 2025-05-19: Transformed Generic Template to Analysis Context Network
- **Documents Processed:**
  - Original generic context network template
- **Changes Made:**
  - Updated discovery.md to reflect analysis focus
  - Created analysis_approach.md in foundation directory
  - Created source_material directory with inventory.md, acquisition.md, and preprocessing.md
  - Created analysis directory with subdirectories for frameworks, patterns, entities, relationships, and findings
  - Created tools directory with subdirectories for requirements, evaluations, and workflows
  - Created template files for each analysis artifact type
  - Updated processes directory with ingestion.md, analysis.md, and synthesis.md
  - Updated README.md to reflect analysis focus
- **Affected Nodes:**
  - context-network/discovery.md - Updated to reflect analysis structure
  - context-network/foundation/analysis_approach.md - Created new node
  - context-network/source_material/inventory.md - Created new node
  - context-network/source_material/acquisition.md - Created new node
  - context-network/source_material/preprocessing.md - Created new node
  - context-network/analysis/patterns/pattern_template.md - Created new node
  - context-network/analysis/entities/entity_template.md - Created new node
  - context-network/analysis/relationships/relationship_template.md - Created new node
  - context-network/analysis/findings/finding_template.md - Created new node
  - context-network/analysis/frameworks/framework_template.md - Created new node
  - context-network/processes/ingestion.md - Created new node
  - context-network/processes/analysis.md - Created new node
  - context-network/processes/synthesis.md - Created new node
  - context-network/tools/requirements/requirement_template.md - Created new node
  - README.md - Updated to reflect analysis focus
- **Rationale:**
  - Specialized the generic context network template for projects focused on analyzing documents, repositories, logs, and similar collections of files
  - Created structure and templates to support systematic analysis of source materials
  - Provided guidance for documenting analysis artifacts (entities, patterns, relationships, findings)
  - Established processes for source material management, analysis, and synthesis
  - Added support for tool requirement development based on analysis findings
- **Follow-up Actions:**
  - Consider creating example analysis artifacts to demonstrate usage
  - Develop additional guidance for specific types of analysis (e.g., code analysis, document analysis)
  - Create templates for analysis reports and presentations
