## Context Network Update: Research Integration Completion - 2025-06-04

### Information Nodes Modified
- processes/analysis.md:
  - Added bidirectional relationship with processes/research.md
  - Content Changes: Added research.md as related node that provides research methodology
- processes/synthesis.md:
  - Added bidirectional relationship with processes/research.md
  - Content Changes: Added research.md as related node that informs synthesis

### Relationships Modified
