## Context Network Update: Monitoring Analysis Preparation - 2025-06-05

### Information Nodes Created
- [analysis/findings/movement_monitoring_analysis.md]: Created initial structure
  - **Content Changes**: Established monitoring categories and reporting framework
  - **Classification Changes**: Set as Dynamic analysis finding
  - **Structure Changes**: Created template for bi-weekly movement monitoring reports

- [analysis/findings/policy_monitoring_analysis.md]: Created initial structure
  - **Content Changes**: Established policy tracking categories and analysis framework
  - **Classification Changes**: Set as Dynamic analysis finding
  - **Structure Changes**: Created template for weekly policy monitoring reports

### New Relationships Established
- [analysis/findings/movement_monitoring_analysis.md] → relates-to → [analysis/findings/policy_monitoring_analysis.md]
- [analysis/findings/movement_monitoring_analysis.md] → relates-to → [analysis/findings/theoretical_frameworks_analysis.md]
- [analysis/findings/policy_monitoring_analysis.md] → relates-to → [analysis/findings/theoretical_frameworks_analysis.md]

### Navigation Implications
- Monitoring analysis documents ready for first reports on 2025-06-10
- Clear categorization structure for tracking developments
- Integrated relationship with theoretical frameworks analysis

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Begin collecting initial data points before first monitoring cycle
- Review monitoring categories after first cycle for any needed adjustments
- Consider creating monitoring dashboards for visual tracking

## Context Network Update: Research Task Completion - 2025-06-05

### Information Nodes Modified
- [research_tasks/foundational/theoretical_frameworks.md]: Updated task status
  - **Content Changes**: Marked task as completed
  - **Classification Changes**: Status changed from "Not Started" to "Completed"
  - **Structure Changes**: Updated completion date and metadata

### Relationships Modified
- [research_tasks/foundational/theoretical_frameworks.md] → implements → [analysis/findings/theoretical_frameworks_analysis.md]

### Navigation Implications
- Theoretical frameworks research task now marked as reference material
- Annual update schedule established for 2026-06-15

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Begin applying theoretical frameworks to other project components
- Schedule review of frameworks before next annual update
- Consider creating synthesis documents for specific framework applications

## Context Network Update: Theoretical Frameworks Research - 2025-06-05

### Information Nodes Modified
- [analysis/findings/theoretical_frameworks_analysis.md]: Updated analysis document
  - **Content Changes**: Added Part 5 - Socialist Cybernetics & Platform Cooperativism
  - **Classification Changes**: None
  - **Structure Changes**: Added new section on Project Cybersyn and modern platform cooperatives

### New Relationships Established
- [analysis/findings/theoretical_frameworks_analysis.md] → relates-to → [analysis/findings/case_studies/project_cybersyn.md]
- [analysis/findings/theoretical_frameworks_analysis.md] → relates-to → [analysis/findings/case_studies/platform_coops.md]

### Navigation Implications
- Socialist cybernetics history and principles now available
- Document provides comprehensive analysis of platform cooperativism
- Historical context for democratic technology planning detailed

### Follow-up Recommendations
- Apply VSM principles to project architecture decisions
- Consider platform cooperative models for implementation
- Explore integration of cybernetic feedback loops in governance
