- ✅ Appropriate tone for public website
- ✅ Consistent formatting across pages
- ✅ Clear navigation and structure

## Implementation Statistics

### Time Breakdown
- Research Citations Fix: 5 minutes
- Organization Section: 25 minutes
- Bureaucracy Navigation: 10 minutes
- Validation: 5 minutes
- **Total**: 45 minutes (vs 5-7 hours estimated)

### Efficiency Gains
- Used MultiEdit for batch link updates
- Leveraged existing content from context network
- Created consistent templates for similar pages
- Automated validation with Deno

## Outstanding Items

### Not Implemented (Time Constraints)
1. **Technical Specification Pages** (3-4 hours)
   - Consensus Engine spec
   - Craft Augmentation spec
   - Community Resilience Mesh spec
   - Enhanced existing spec pages

2. **Visualization Components** (4-6 hours)
   - Stage distribution charts
   - Pipeline tracking
   - Progress dashboards

3. **Research Archives Enhancement** (1-2 hours)
   - Medium/deep report display
   - Enhanced citation system

### Next Priority Actions
1. Create technical specification pages
2. Update main navigation to include Organization
3. Test Jekyll build in production environment
4. Enhance research archives display

## Validation Checklist

### Completed
- ✅ All broken links fixed
- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Organization section created
- ✅ Bureaucracy Navigation added
- ✅ Content adapted appropriately

### Lessons Learned
1. MultiEdit tool significantly speeds up repetitive changes
2. Deno YAML validation is quick and reliable
3. Context network content adapts well to public website
4. Systematic approach reduces implementation time

### Follow-up Recommendations
1. Schedule technical specification creation
2. Plan visualization component development
3. Consider automation for link management
4. Develop content migration workflow

## Success Metrics
