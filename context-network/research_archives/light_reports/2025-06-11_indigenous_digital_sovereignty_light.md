**Indigenous Digital Sovereignty and Technology Self-Determination: A High-Level Research Summary**

Indigenous digital sovereignty encompasses the right of Indigenous communities to govern their digital ecosystems, including internet connectivity, data privacy, and digital infrastructure, in alignment with their unique cultural and governance needs[1][4]. This concept is closely tied to technology self-determination, allowing Indigenous nations to implement policies that reflect their values and traditions[4].

**Key Findings:**
- **Digital Sovereignty**: This involves the creation of self-governing digital policies by Indigenous communities, similar to how countries manage their digital policies[4].
- **Data Sovereignty**: Indigenous peoples aim to control the collection, storage, and interpretation of their data, ensuring it is used in a culturally appropriate manner[3][5].
- **Challenges and Opportunities**: While navigating digital sovereignty presents challenges, it also offers Indigenous leaders a platform to engage on equal terms and leverage technology for self-determination[4].
