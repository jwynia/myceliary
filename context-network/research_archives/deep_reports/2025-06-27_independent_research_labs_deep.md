- **Community**: Alumni network fostering experimental culture

### Future of Coding
- **Model**: Online community (Slack/Matrix)
- **Focus**: Reimagining computing paradigms
- **Activities**: Podcasts, newsletters, local meetups

## Funding Models Analysis

### 1. Sponsorship Mix
- Individual philanthropists
- Corporate sponsors (without control)
- Government/foundation grants
- Key: Diverse sources prevent capture

### 2. Community Support
- Workshop fees
- Residency programs
- Membership models
- Publications/events

### 3. Open Source Sustainability
- Core research open/public
- Some spin-off products (e.g., Muse from Ink & Switch)
- Consulting/services revenue

### 4. Consortium/Network Models
- Protocol Labs coordinates without owning
- Shared funding pools
- Distributed decision-making

## Key Principles Across Labs

### 1. Research Freedom
- No quarterly targets or shareholder pressure
- Multi-year investigation horizons
- Failed experiments valued as learning

### 2. Human-Centered Design
- Tools respect user agency/privacy
- Democratize creation (not just consumption)
- Local-first/offline-first architectures

### 3. Open Knowledge
- Published research freely available
- Source code often open
- Educational mission central

### 4. Interdisciplinary Teams
- Artists + engineers + scientists
- Community involvement in design
- Breaking programmer/user divide

## Parallels to Myceliary Project

### Shared Values
1. **Anti-capitalist orientation**: Explicitly rejecting surveillance capitalism and platform monopolies
2. **Democratization focus**: Making powerful tools accessible beyond technical elites
3. **Community benefit**: Prioritizing collective good over profit extraction
4. **Knowledge commons**: Open research and shared learning

### Operational Parallels
1. **Research-first approach**: Deep investigation before implementation
2. **Framework development**: Creating analytical tools (like myceliary's anti-capitalist framework)
3. **Citation/documentation culture**: Rigorous knowledge management
4. **Network building**: Connecting practitioners globally

### Key Differences
1. **Technical vs. analytical focus**: Labs build software; myceliary builds frameworks
2. **Funding needs**: Labs need significant resources; myceliary more lightweight
3. **Output types**: Labs produce tools; myceliary produces knowledge/analysis

## Insights for Alternative Models

### Success Factors
1. **Clear mission beyond profit**: Attracts aligned supporters
2. **Tangible outputs**: Demonstrable impact maintains funding
3. **Community cultivation**: Networks amplify individual lab impact
4. **Hybrid structures**: Mixing funding sources ensures resilience

### Challenges
1. **Financial sustainability**: Constant fundraising pressure
2. **Scale limitations**: Small teams limit scope
3. **Mainstream adoption**: Radical approaches face adoption barriers
4. **Ideological purity vs. pragmatism**: Balancing values with survival

### Emerging Patterns
1. **Post-screen computing**: Moving beyond traditional interfaces
2. **Decentralization**: Technical and organizational
3. **Craft/quality focus**: Opposing disposable tech culture
4. **Educational integration**: Research tied to learning/teaching

## Future Directions

### Convergent Trends
1. Growing disillusionment with surveillance capitalism
2. Climate crisis demanding low-power alternatives
3. Democratization movements including computational literacy
4. Renewed interest in software craftsmanship

### Opportunities
1. **Collaborative funding models**: Shared pools across aligned labs
2. **Research cooperatives**: Formal structures for knowledge sharing
3. **Public option labs**: Government-funded alternatives to corporate R&D
4. **Global south initiatives**: Decolonizing computing research

## Conclusion
Independent research labs demonstrate viable alternatives to corporate/academic models. Their focus on human benefit over profit, commitment to open knowledge, and experimental organizational structures offer templates for building technology that serves collective rather than capitalist interests. The myceliary project can learn from their funding models, community building approaches, and balance of idealism with pragmatic sustainability.
