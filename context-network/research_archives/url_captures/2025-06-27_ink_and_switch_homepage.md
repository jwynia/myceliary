**An independent research lab exploring the future of tools for thought.**

We envision a new computer that amplifies human intelligence. A system that helps you think more clearly, collaborate more effectively, and is available anywhere and anytime. Though the specifics of our work continue to evolve, everything we do is in pursuit of this vision.

### Research Areas

Our research spans a wide variety of domains from theoretical computer science to practical user experiences. We focus our research on four primary themes.

#### Local-first Software
Exploring software architecture that returns data to users and enables collaboration in every tool.

#### Malleable Software
Designing software environments where people can customize tools in the moment to meet their unique needs.

#### Programmable Ink
Discovering a dynamic medium for sketching ideas where adding behaviors and interaction is as natural as applying ink to paper.

#### Universal Version Control
Building tools to help people explore alternatives, keep track of history, and collaborate better, across all kinds of media.

### Featured Work

We publish the results of our research here on our website and in academic venues. Below you'll find a selection of our most popular essays and recent lab notebooks.

- **Ambsheets**: Spreadsheets for exploring scenarios - Inventing new kinds of spreadsheets for exploring possibility spaces and making better decisions. [Lab Notes] ongoing

- **Keyhive**: Local-first access control - A local-first access control system with capabilities and end-to-end encryption for secure & trusted collaboration. [Lab Notes] ongoing

- **Embark**: Dynamic documents for making plans - An exploration of how live data and computation can gradually enrich informal travel plans. [Essay] 2023

- **Inkbase**: Programmable ink - What would be possible if hand-drawn sketches were programmable like spreadsheets? [Essay] 2022

- **Local-first software**: You own your data, in spite of the cloud - A new generation of collaborative software that allows users to retain ownership of their data. [Essay] 2019

### Production Software

Several of our research projects have grown into actively developed, widely used tools.

#### Muse
A digital workspace where users can brainstorm, organize, and connect ideas visually using a flexible canvas for notes, sketches, PDFs, and other media.

#### Automerge
A library for building collaborative applications that automatically sync changes across devices, even offline, using conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).

### Lab Meta

Our lab owes its existence to the support of a handful of people and organizations. They share our goal: to help scientists, journalists, and creative thinkers do important work with powerful tools that respect their humanity.

#### Supporters
Our ongoing research is supported by individual and corporate sponsors, and grants from bodies around the world.

### Appearances

Although we are best known for our writing, members of Ink & Switch occasionally present at both industry and academic conferences.

- **J On the Beach** 2025 MAY 14-16: Lab director Peter van Hardenberg delivers a talk on Practical Local-First Software With Automerge in Malaga, Spain.

- **Local-first Conference** 2025 MAY 26-28: A handful of us from the lab will be in Berlin for this, the second annual conference dedicated to local-first software.
