## [Motivation: collaboration and ownership](#motivation-collaboration-and-ownership)

It's amazing how easily we can collaborate online nowadays. We use Google Docs to collaborate on documents, spreadsheets and presentations; in Figma we work together on user interface designs; we communicate with colleagues using Slack; we track tasks in Trello; and so on. We depend on these and many other online services, e.g. for taking notes, planning projects or events, remembering contacts, and a whole raft of business uses.

Today's cloud apps offer big benefits compared to earlier generations of software: seamless collaboration, and being able to access data from any device. As we run more and more of our lives and work through these cloud apps, they become more and more critical to us. The more time we invest in using one of these apps, the more valuable the data in it becomes to us.

However, in our research we have spoken to a lot of creative professionals, and in that process we have also learned about the downsides of cloud apps.

When you have put a lot of creative energy and effort into making something, you tend to have a deep emotional attachment to it. If you do creative work, this probably seems familiar. (When we say "creative work," we mean not just visual art, or music, or poetry — many other activities, such as explaining a technical topic, implementing an intricate algorithm, designing a user interface, or figuring out how to lead a team towards some goal are also creative efforts.)

In the process of performing that creative work, you typically produce files and data: documents, presentations, spreadsheets, code, notes, drawings, and so on. And you will want to keep that data: for reference and inspiration in the future, to include it in a portfolio, or simply to archive because you feel proud of it. It is important to _feel ownership_ of that data, because the creative expression is something so personal.

Unfortunately, cloud apps are problematic in this regard. Although they let you access your data anywhere, all data access must go via the server, and you can only do the things that the server will let you do. In a sense, you don't have full ownership of that data — the cloud provider does. In the words of a [bumper sticker](http://www.chriswatterston.com/blog/my-there-is-no-cloud-sticker): "There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computer."

When data is stored on "someone else's computer", that third party assumes a degree of control over that data. Cloud apps are provided as a service; if the service is unavailable, you cannot use the software, and you can no longer access your data created with that software. If the service shuts down, even though you might be able to export your data, without the servers there is normally no way for you to continue running your own copy of that software. Thus, you are at the mercy of the company providing the service.

Before web apps came along, we had what we might call "old-fashioned" apps: programs running on your local computer, reading and writing files on the local disk. We still use a lot of applications of this type today: text editors and IDEs, Git and other version control systems, and many specialized software packages such as graphics applications or CAD software fall in this category.

In old-fashioned apps, the data lives in files on your local disk, so you have full agency and ownership of that data: you can do anything you like, including long-term archiving, making backups, manipulating the files using other programs, or deleting the files if you no longer want them. You don't need anybody's permission to access your files, since they are yours. You don't have to depend on servers operated by another company.

To sum up: the cloud gives us collaboration, but old-fashioned apps give us ownership. Can't we have the best of both worlds?

We would like both the convenient cross-device access and real-time collaboration provided by cloud apps, and also the personal ownership of your own data embodied by "old-fashioned" software.

## [Seven ideals for local-first software](#seven-ideals-for-local-first-software)

We believe that data ownership and real-time collaboration are not at odds with each other. It is possible to create software that has all the advantages of cloud apps, while also allowing you to retain full ownership of the data, documents and files you create.

We call this type of software **local-first software**, since it prioritizes the use of local storage (the disk built into your computer) and local networks (such as your home WiFi) over servers in remote datacenters.

In cloud apps, the data on the server is treated as the primary, authoritative copy of the data; if a client has a copy of the data, it is merely a cache that is subordinate to the server. Any data modification must be sent to the server, otherwise it "didn't happen." In local-first applications we swap these roles: we treat the copy of the data on your local device — your laptop, tablet, or phone — as the primary copy. Servers still exist, but they hold secondary copies of your data in order to assist with access from multiple devices. As we shall see, this change in perspective has profound implications.

Here are seven ideals we would like to strive for in local-first software.

### [1\. No spinners: your work at your fingertips](#1-no-spinners-your-work-at-your-fingertips)

Much of today's software [feels slower](https://danluu.com/input-lag/) than previous generations of software. Even though CPUs have become ever faster, there is often a perceptible delay between some user input (e.g. clicking a button, or hitting a key) and the corresponding result appearing on the display. In [previous work](https://www.inkandswitch.com/slow-software) we measured the performance of modern software and analyzed why these delays occur.

![Server-to-server round-trip times between various locations worldwide](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/world-ping-times.png)

Server-to-server round-trip times between AWS datacenters in various locations worldwide. Data from: Peter Bailis, Aaron Davidson, Alan Fekete, et al.: "[Highly Available Transactions: Virtues and Limitations](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.0309.pdf)," VLDB 2014.

With cloud apps, since the primary copy of the data is on a server, all data modifications, and many data lookups, require a round-trip to a server. Depending on where you live, the server may well be located on another continent, so the speed of light places a limit on how fast the software can be.

Local-first software is different: because it keeps the primary copy of the data on the local device, there is never a need for the user to wait for a request to a server to complete. All operations can be handled by reading and writing files on the local disk, and data synchronization with other devices happens quietly in the background.

While this by itself does not guarantee that the software will be fast, we expect that local-first software has the potential to respond near-instantaneously to user input, never needing to show you a spinner while you wait, and allowing you to operate with your data at your fingertips.

### [2\. Your work is not trapped on one device](#2-your-work-is-not-trapped-on-one-device)

Users today rely on several computing devices to do their work, and modern applications must support such workflows. For example, users may capture ideas on the go using their smartphone, organize and think through those ideas [on a tablet](https://www.inkandswitch.com/capstone), and then type up the outcome as a document on their laptop.

This means that while local-first apps keep their data in local storage on each device, it is also necessary for that data to be synchronized across all of the devices on which a user does their work. Various data synchronization technologies exist, and we discuss them in detail in a [later section](#existing-data-storage-and-sharing-models).

Most cross-device sync services also store a copy of the data on a server, which provides a convenient off-site backup for the data. These solutions work quite well as long as each file is only edited by one person at a time. If several people edit the same file at the same time, conflicts may arise, which we discuss in the [section on collaboration](#4-seamless-collaboration-with-your-colleagues).

### [3\. The network is optional](#3-the-network-is-optional)

Personal mobile devices move through areas of varying network availability: unreliable coffee shop WiFi, while on a plane or on a train going through a tunnel, in an elevator or a parking garage. In developing countries or rural areas, infrastructure for Internet access is sometimes patchy. While traveling internationally, many mobile users disable cellular data due to the cost of roaming. Overall, there is plenty of need for offline-capable apps, such as for researchers or journalists who need to write while in the field.

"Old-fashioned" apps work fine without an Internet connection, but cloud apps typically don't work while offline. For several years the [Offline First](http://offlinefirst.org/) movement has been encouraging developers of web and mobile apps to improve offline support, but in practice it has been difficult to retrofit offline support to cloud apps, because tools and libraries designed for a server-centric model do not easily adapt to situations in which users make edits while offline.

Since local-first applications store the primary copy of their data in each device's local filesystem, the user can read and write this data anytime, even while offline. It is then synchronized with other devices sometime later, when a network connection is available. The data synchronization need not necessarily go via the Internet: local-first apps could also use Bluetooth or local WiFi to sync data to nearby devices.

Moreover, for good offline support it is desirable for the software to run as a locally installed executable on your device, rather than a tab in a web browser. For mobile apps it is already standard that the whole app is downloaded and installed before it is used.

### [4\. Seamless collaboration with your colleagues](#4-seamless-collaboration-with-your-colleagues)

Collaboration typically requires that several people contribute material to a document or file. However, in old-fashioned software it is problematic for several people to work on the same file at the same time: the result is often a _conflict_. In text files such as source code, resolving conflicts is tedious and annoying, and the task quickly becomes very difficult or impossible for complex file formats such as spreadsheets or graphics documents. Hence, collaborators may have to agree up front who is going to edit a file, and only have one person at a time who may make changes.

A ["conflicted copy"](https://help.dropbox.com/syncing-uploads/conflicted-copy) on Dropbox. The user must merge the changes manually.

![A note with conflicting edits in Evernote](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/evernote-conflict.png)

In Evernote, if a note is changed concurrently, it is moved to a ["conflicting changes" notebook](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/86113-how-do-i-resolve-sync-conflicts/), and there is nothing to support the user in resolving the situation — not even a facility to compare the different versions of a note.

![Resolving a Git merge conflict with DiffMerge](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/merge-conflict.png)

In Git and other version control systems, several people may modify the same file in different commits. Combining those changes often results in [merge conflicts](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#_basic_merge_conflicts), which can be resolved using specialized tools (such as [DiffMerge](https://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/), shown here). These tools are primarily designed for line-oriented text files such as source code; for other file formats, tool support is much weaker.

On the other hand, cloud apps such as Google Docs have vastly simplified collaboration by allowing multiple users to edit a document simultaneously, without having to send files back and forth by email and without worrying about conflicts. Users have come to expect this kind of seamless real-time collaboration in a wide range of applications.

In local-first apps, our ideal is to support real-time collaboration that is on par with the best cloud apps today, or better. Achieving this goal is one of the biggest challenges in realizing local-first software, but we believe it is possible: in a [later section](#towards-a-better-future) we discuss technologies that enable real-time collaboration in a local-first setting.

Moreover, we expect that local-first apps can support various workflows for collaboration. Besides having several people edit the same document in real-time, it is sometimes useful for one person to tentatively propose changes that can be reviewed and selectively applied by someone else. Google Docs supports this workflow with its [suggesting mode](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6033474), and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) serve this purpose in GitHub.

![Suggesting changes in Google Docs](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/suggest-changes.png)

In Google Docs, collaborators can either edit the document directly, or they can [suggest changes](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6033474), which can then be accepted or rejected by the document owner.

![A pull request on GitHub](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/pull-request.png)

The collaboration workflow on GitHub is based on [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). A user may change multiple source files in multiple commits, and submit them as a proposed change to a project. Other users may review and amend the pull request before it is finally merged or rejected.

### [5\. The Long Now](#5-the-long-now)

An important aspect of data ownership is that you can continue accessing the data for a long time in the future. When you do some work with local-first software, your work should continue to be accessible indefinitely, even after the company that produced the software is gone.

![Cuneiform script on clay tablet, ca. 3000 BCE](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/cuneiform.jpg)

"Old-fashioned" apps continue to work forever, as long as you have a copy of the data and some way of running the software. Even if the software author goes bust, you can continue running the last released version of the software. Even if the operating system and the computer it runs on become obsolete, you can still run the software in a virtual machine or emulator. As storage media evolve over the decades, you can copy your files to new storage media and continue to access them.

On the other hand, cloud apps depend on the service continuing to be available: if the service is unavailable, you cannot use the software, and you can no longer access your data created with that software. This means you are betting that the creators of the software will continue supporting it for a long time — at least as long as you care about the data.

Although there does not seem to be a great danger of Google shutting down Google Docs anytime soon, [popular products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) do sometimes [get shut down](https://killedbygoogle.com/) or [lose data](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/myspace-songs-lost-website-move-migration-mp3-music-server-accounts-a8827881.html), so we know to be careful. And even with long-lived software there is the risk that the pricing or features change in a way you don't like, and with a cloud app, continuing to use the old version is not an option — you will be upgraded whether you like it or not.

Local-first software enables greater longevity because your data, and the software that is needed to read and modify your data, are all stored locally on your computer. We believe this is important not just for your own sake, but also for future historians who will want to read the documents we create today. Without longevity of our data, we risk creating [what Vint Cerf calls a "digital Dark Age](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31450389)."

Some file formats (such as plain text, JPEG, and PDF) are so ubiquitous that they will probably be readable for centuries to come. The US Library of Congress also [recommends XML, JSON, or SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html) as archival formats for datasets. However, in order to read less common file formats and to preserve interactivity, you need to be able to run the original software (if necessary, in a virtual machine or emulator). Local-first software enables this.

### [6\. Security and privacy by default](#6-security-and-privacy-by-default)

One problem with the architecture of cloud apps is that they store all the data from all of their users in a centralized database. This large collection of data is an attractive target for attackers: a [rogue](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwnva7/snapchat-employees-abused-data-access-spy-on-users-snaplion) [employee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/is-anyone-listening-to-you-on-alexa-a-global-team-reviews-audio), or a hacker who gains access to the company's servers, can read and tamper with all of your data. Such security breaches are sadly [terrifyingly common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches), and with cloud apps we are unfortunately at the mercy of the provider.

While Google has a world-class security team, the sad reality is that most companies do not. And while Google is good at defending your data against external attackers, the company internally is free to use your data in a myriad ways, such as feeding your data into its machine learning systems.

Maybe you feel that your data would not be of interest to any attacker. However, for many professions, dealing with sensitive data is an important part of their work. For example, medical professionals handle sensitive patient data, investigative journalists handle confidential information from sources, governments and diplomatic representatives conduct sensitive negotiations, and so on. Many of these professionals cannot use cloud apps due to regulatory compliance and confidentiality obligations.

Local-first apps, on the other hand, have better privacy and security built in at the core. Your local devices store only your own data, avoiding the centralized cloud database holding everybody's data. Local-first apps can use _end-to-end encryption_ so that any servers that store a copy of your files only hold encrypted data that they cannot read.

### [7\. You retain ultimate ownership and control](#7-you-retain-ultimate-ownership-and-control)

With cloud apps, the service provider has the power to restrict user access: for example, in October 2017, several Google Docs users were [locked out of their documents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/10/31/a-mysterious-message-is-locking-google-docs-users-out-of-their-files/) because an automated system incorrectly flagged these documents as abusive. In local-first apps, the ownership of data is vested in the user.

To disambiguate "ownership" in this context: we don't mean it in the legal sense of intellectual property. A word processor, for example, should be oblivious to the question of who owns the copyright in the text being edited. Instead we mean ownership in the sense of user agency, autonomy, and control over data. You should be able to copy and modify data in any way, write down any thought, and no company should restrict what you are allowed to do.

In cloud apps, the ways in which you can access and modify your data are limited by the APIs, user interfaces, and terms of service of the service provider. With local-first software, all of the bytes that comprise your data are stored on your own device, so you have the freedom to process this data in arbitrary ways.

With data ownership comes responsibility: maintaining backups or other preventative measures against data loss, protecting against ransomware, and general organizing and managing of file archives. For many professional and creative users, as introduced in [the introduction](#motivation-collaboration-and-ownership), we believe that the trade-off of more responsibility in exchange for more ownership is desirable. Consider a significant personal creation, such as a PhD thesis or the raw footage of a film. For these you might be willing to take responsibility for storage and backups in order to be certain that your data is safe and fully under your control.

## [Existing data storage and sharing models](#existing-data-storage-and-sharing-models)

We believe professional and creative users deserve software that realizes the local-first goals, helping them collaborate seamlessly while also allowing them to retain full ownership of their work. If we can give users these qualities in the software they use to do their most important work, we can help them be better at what they do, and potentially make a significant difference to many people's professional lives.

However, while the ideals of local-first software may resonate with you, you may still be wondering how achievable they are in practice. Are they just utopian thinking?

In the remainder of this article we discuss what it means to realize local-first software in practice. We look at a wide range of existing technologies and break down how well they satisfy the local-first ideals. In the following tables, ✓ means the technology meets the ideal, — means it partially meets the ideal, and ✗ means it does not meet the ideal.

As we shall see, many technologies satisfy some of the goals, but none are able to satisfy them all. Finally, we examine a technique from the cutting edge of computer science research that might be a foundational piece in realizing local-first software in the future.

### [How application architecture affects user experience](#how-application-architecture-affects-user-experience)

Viewed through the lens of our seven goals, traditional files have many desirable properties: they can be viewed and edited offline, they give full control to users, and they can readily be backed up and preserved for the long term. Software relying on local files also has the potential to be very fast.

However, accessing files from multiple devices is trickier. It is possible to transfer a file across devices using various technologies:

*   Sending it back and forth by email;
*   Passing a USB drive back and forth;
*   Via a distributed file system such as a [NAS server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage), [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), or [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync);
*   Using a cloud file storage service like [Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive](#dropbox-google-drive-box-onedrive-etc);
*   Using a version control system such as [Git](#git-and-github).

Of these, email attachments are probably the most common sharing mechanism, especially among users who are not technical experts. Attachments are easy to understand and trustworthy. Once you have a copy of a document, it does not spontaneously change: if you view an email six months later, the attachments are still there in their original form. Unlike a web app, an attachment can be opened without any additional login process.

The weakest point of email attachments is collaboration. Generally, only one person at a time can make changes to a file, otherwise a difficult manual merge is required. File versioning quickly becomes messy: a back-and-forth email thread with attachments often leads to filenames such as `Budget draft 2 (Jane's version) final final 3.xls`.

Nevertheless, for apps that want to incorporate local-first ideas, a good starting point is to offer an export feature that produces a widely-supported file format (e.g. plain text, PDF, PNG, or JPEG) and allows it to be shared e.g. via email attachment, Slack, or WhatsApp.

At the opposite end of the spectrum are pure web apps, where the user's local software (web browser or mobile app) is a thin client and the data storage resides on a server. The server typically uses a large-scale database in which the data of millions of users are all mixed together in one giant collection.

Web apps have set the standard for real-time collaboration. As a user you can trust that when you open a document on any device, you are seeing the most current and up-to-date version. This is so overwhelmingly useful for team work that these applications have become dominant. Even traditionally local-only software like Microsoft Office is making the transition to cloud services, with [Office 365 eclipsing locally-installed Office as of 2017](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/microsoft-office-365-earnings/).

With the rise of [remote work and distributed teams](https://medium.com/@anupamr/distributed-teams-are-the-new-cloud-for-startups-14240a9822d7), real-time collaborative productivity tools are becoming even more important. Ten users on a team video call can bring up the same Trello board and each make edits on their own computer while simultaneously seeing what other users are doing.

The flip side to this is a total loss of ownership and control: the data on the server is what counts, and any data on your client device is unimportant — it is merely a cache. Most web apps have little or no support for offline working: if your network hiccups for even a moment, you are locked out of your work mid-sentence.

![Offline indicator in Google Docs](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/gdocs-offline.png)

If Google Docs detects that it is offline, it blocks editing of the document.

A few of the best web apps [hide the latency of server communication](https://uxplanet.org/optimistic-1000-34d9eefe4c05) using JavaScript, and try to provide limited offline support (for example, the [Google Docs offline plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-offline/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi)). However, these efforts appear retrofitted to an application architecture that is fundamentally centered on synchronous interaction with a server. Users report mixed results when trying to work offline.

Some web apps, for example Milanote and Figma, offer installable desktop clients that are essentially repackaged web browsers. If you try to use these clients to access your work while your network is intermittent, while the vendor's servers are experiencing an outage, or after the vendor has been acquired and shut down, it becomes clear that your work was never truly yours.

Cloud-based file sync products like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [Box](https://www.box.com/), or [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) make files available on multiple devices. On desktop operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS) these tools work by watching a designated folder on the local file system. Any software on your computer can read and write files in this folder, and whenever a file is changed on one computer, it is automatically copied to all of your other computers.

As these tools use the local filesystem, they have many attractive properties: access to local files is fast, and working offline is no problem (files edited offline are synced the next time an Internet connection is available). If the sync service were shut down, your files would still remain unharmed on your local disk, and it would be easy to switch to a different syncing service. If your computer's hard drive fails, you can restore your work simply by installing the app and waiting for it to sync. This provides good longevity and control over your data.

However, on mobile platforms (iOS and Android), Dropbox and its cousins use a completely different model. The mobile apps do not synchronize an entire folder — instead, they are thin clients that fetch your data from a server one file at a time, and by default they do not work offline. There is a ["Make available offline"](https://help.dropbox.com/mobile/access-files-offline) option, but you need to remember to invoke it ahead of going offline, it is clumsy, and only works when the app is open. The [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) is also very server-centric.

![The Dropbox mobile app showing a spinner while waiting to download a file](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/dropbox-mobile.jpg)

Users of the Dropbox mobile app spend a lot of time looking at spinners, a stark contrast to the at-your-fingertips feeling of the Dropbox desktop product.

The weakest point of file sync products is the lack of real-time collaboration: if the same file is edited on two different devices, the result is a conflict that needs to be merged manually, as discussed [previously](#4-seamless-collaboration-with-your-colleagues). The fact that these tools synchronize files in any format is both a strength (compatibility with any application) and a weakness (inability to perform format-specific merges).

Git+GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are primarily used by software engineers to collaborate on source code. They are perhaps the closest thing we have to a true local-first software package: compared to server-centric version control systems such as [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), Git works fully offline, it is fast, it gives full control to users, and it is suitable for long-term preservation of data. This is the case because a Git repository on your local filesystem is a primary copy of the data, and is not subordinate to any server.

A repository hosting service like GitHub enables collaboration around Git repositories, accessing data from multiple devices, as well as providing a backup and archival location. Support for mobile devices is currently weak, although [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) is a promising Git client for iOS. GitHub stores repositories unencrypted; if stronger privacy is required, it is possible for you to run your own repository server.

We think the Git model points the way toward a future for local-first software. However, as it currently stands, Git has two major weaknesses:

1.  Git is excellent for asynchronous collaboration, especially using [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests), which take a coarse-grained set of changes and allow them to be discussed and amended before merging them into the shared master branch. But Git has no capability for real-time, fine-grained collaboration, such as the automatic, instantaneous merging that occurs in tools like Google Docs, Trello, and Figma.
2.  Git is highly optimized for code and similar line-based text files; other file formats are treated as binary blobs that cannot meaningfully be edited or merged. Despite GitHub's efforts to display and compare [images](https://github.blog/2011-03-21-behold-image-view-modes/), [prose](https://github.blog/2014-02-14-rendered-prose-diffs/), and [CAD files](https://github.blog/2013-09-17-3d-file-diffs/), non-textual file formats remain second-class in Git.

It's interesting to note that most software engineers have been reluctant to embrace cloud software for their editors, IDEs, runtime environments, and build tools. In theory, we might expect this demographic of sophisticated users to embrace newer technologies sooner than other types of users. But if you ask an engineer why they don't use a cloud-based editor like [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) or [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), or a runtime environment like [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), the answers will usually include "it's too slow" or "I don't trust it" or "I want my code on my local system." These sentiments seem to reflect some of the same motivations as local-first software. If we as developers want these things for ourselves and our work, perhaps we might imagine that other types of creative professionals would want these same qualities for their own work.

## [Conclusions](#conclusions)

Computers are one of the most important creative tools mankind has ever produced. Software has become the conduit through which our work is done and the repository in which that work resides.

In the pursuit of better tools we moved many applications to the cloud. Cloud software is in many regards superior to "old-fashioned" software: it offers collaborative, always-up-to-date applications, accessible from anywhere in the world. We no longer worry about what software version we are running, or what machine a file lives on.

However, in the cloud, ownership of data is vested in the servers, not the users, and so we became borrowers of our own data. The documents created in cloud apps are destined to disappear when the creators of those services cease to maintain them. Cloud services defy long-term preservation. No Wayback Machine can restore a sunsetted web application. The Internet Archive cannot preserve your Google Docs.

In this article we explored a new way forward for software of the future. We have shown that it is possible for users to retain ownership and control of their data, while also benefiting from the features we associate with the cloud: seamless collaboration and access from anywhere. It is possible to get the best of both worlds.

But more work is needed to realize the local-first approach in practice. Application developers can take incremental steps, such as improving offline support and making better use of on-device storage. Researchers can continue improving the algorithms, programming models, and user interfaces for local-first software. Entrepreneurs can develop foundational technologies such as CRDTs and peer-to-peer networking into mature products able to power the next generation of applications.

Today it is easy to create a web application in which the server takes ownership of all the data. But it is too hard to build collaborative software that respects users' ownership and agency. In order to shift the balance, we need to improve the tools for developing local-first software. We hope that you will join us.
