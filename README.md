# Myceliary - Anti-Capitalist AI Framework Project

## About the Name

"Myceliary" draws inspiration from mycelial networks - the vast, interconnected fungal systems that facilitate communication and resource sharing in natural ecosystems. The name reflects several key aspects of our project:

- **Network Structure**: Like mycelial networks that connect different parts of an ecosystem, our context network creates interconnected pathways between research, analysis, and community knowledge.
  
- **Organic Growth**: Just as mycelial networks grow and adapt organically to their environment, our frameworks evolve through community use and adaptation rather than top-down imposition.
  
- **Resource Sharing**: Mycelial networks facilitate nutrient exchange between organisms. Similarly, our project aims to enable knowledge and resource sharing between communities developing anti-capitalist technology.
  
- **Underground Resistance**: Much like the hidden but vital mycelial networks beneath the forest floor, our work supports the often invisible but essential infrastructure of community resistance and mutual aid.

The adjective form "myceliary" ("of or relating to mycelial networks") emphasizes our focus on building interconnected systems of knowledge and practice that support community-controlled technology development outside of capitalist structures.

## Project Overview

This project develops and shares frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and building AI and LLM applications that serve human needs outside of or in opposition to capitalist structures. Rather than cataloging specific use cases, we focus on inquiry methodologies, evaluation frameworks, and collaborative tools that help communities and technologists discover opportunities where AI could genuinely serve liberation rather than extraction.

## Core Problem

Most AI development follows profit-driven patterns, creating tools that optimize exploitation, extract data for corporate benefit, or provide technological solutions to problems created by capitalism itself. Meanwhile, genuine human needs that capitalism systematically ignores or actively harms remain unaddressed by AI innovation. Communities need frameworks to identify these gaps, evaluate proposed solutions for hidden traps, and build genuinely community-controlled alternatives.

## Primary Frameworks

### Framework for Identifying Anti-Capitalist AI Applications
- Systematic inquiry methodology for discovering AI applications outside capitalist incentives
- Analysis tools for market failure spaces, counter-hegemonic potential, and democratization opportunities
- Integration of temporal, ecological, epistemological, and security considerations
- Community-centered evaluation criteria and implementation guidance

### Capitalist Trap Detection and Solution Strengthening Framework
- Methods for identifying when AI solutions that appear helpful actually serve capitalist interests
- Analysis tools for common trap patterns: efficiency, individualization, platform dependency, data extraction, innovation theater, and algorithmic gatekeeping
- Systematic process for strengthening community-controlled alternatives
- Evaluation checklists and red flag identification systems

### Research Query Framework
- Structured approach to ongoing research and monitoring
- Query categories from basic web search to deep research reports
- Temporal organization for one-time foundational research and ongoing monitoring
- Crisis-responsive and geographically diverse research strategies

## Target Audiences

**Primary Users:**
- Community organizers and activists exploring technology tools
- Technologists seeking to redirect their work toward liberatory purposes
- Researchers studying community technology and digital justice
- Cooperative and solidarity economy practitioners
- Digital rights and algorithmic justice advocates

**Secondary Users:**
- Grant makers and funding organizations evaluating community technology projects
- Policy researchers analyzing alternatives to corporate AI development
- Academic researchers in critical technology studies
- Community organizations assessing technology proposals or partnerships

## Context Network Structure

This project uses a context network to organize its knowledge and frameworks. The network is structured as follows:

```
context-network/

│   ├── project_definition.md       # Project goals and vision
│   ├── principles.md              # Guiding principles
│   └── analysis_approach.md       # Overall methodology
├── analysis/                      # Analysis frameworks

└── [additional sections]         # Decisions, connections, etc.
```

## Getting Started

1. **Understand the Project**:
   - Read `foundation/project_definition.md` for project goals and vision
   - Review `foundation/principles.md` for guiding principles
   - Explore `foundation/analysis_approach.md` for methodology

2. **Use the Frameworks**:
   - `analysis/frameworks/anti_capitalist_framework.md` for identifying opportunities
   - `analysis/frameworks/capitalist_trap_detector.md` for evaluating solutions
   - `processes/research.md` for research methodology

3. **Contribute**:
   - Follow the process in `processes/document_integration.md`
   - Use templates from relevant directories
   - Document your findings in appropriate sections

## Stay Updated

Follow our Substack newsletter at [myceliary.substack.com](https://myceliary.substack.com/) for:
- Regular updates on framework development
- Analysis of emerging anti-capitalist AI initiatives
- Case studies and community insights
- Opportunities for collaboration and contribution

## Development Approach

### Community-Centered Development
- Framework development guided by feedback from communities actually using these tools
- Regular testing and iteration based on real-world application experiences
- Governance structures that maintain community accountability
- Integration with existing community technology and organizing networks

### Anti-Capitalist Infrastructure
- Project sustainability through grants and donations that don't compromise independence
- Governance structures that prevent mission drift or co-optation
- Technology choices that maintain community control
- Resource sharing with other community technology and organizing projects

## Long-Term Vision

This project aims to contribute to a broader ecosystem of community-controlled technology development that serves liberation rather than extraction. We envision communities equipped with analysis tools that help them navigate technological choices with clear anti-capitalist frameworks, resist corporate co-optation of their initiatives, and build genuinely community-controlled alternatives that strengthen collective power and mutual aid.

The frameworks developed here should become tools that communities adapt and improve based on their own needs and contexts, contributing to a knowledge commons that strengthens community technology work across diverse struggles and geographies. Success means these frameworks become unnecessary because communities have internalized the analysis and developed their own locally appropriate tools for community-controlled technology development.
