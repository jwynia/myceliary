## Progress Themes

### 1. Research Infrastructure Maturation
Evolution from ad-hoc research to systematic archival and citation systems with clear integration workflows.

### 2. Implementation Readiness
Transition from conceptual frameworks to detailed technical specifications with concrete implementation guidance.

### 3. Organizational Development
Movement beyond pure research toward sustainable organizational structures and funding models.

### 4. Tool Optimization
Command system realigned for research-focused workflows rather than traditional software development patterns.

## Files Modified/Created (Summary)

### Documentation (12 files)
- New: `craft-augmentation.md`, `bureaucracy-navigation.md`, 4 organization files
- Enhanced: research archives, consensus engine documentation

### Context Network (8+ files)
