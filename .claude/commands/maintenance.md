Research archive and knowledge base maintenance

## Usage

Systematically review and maintain the integrity of the research archive and context network to ensure they remain valuable, navigable, and accurate reflections of current knowledge.

## Maintenance Scope

When maintaining the research knowledge base, perform these systematic checks:

### 1. Research Archive Integrity Audit

**Research Organization**
- Verify all research files follow the archive structure
- Check that research documents are properly categorized
- Ensure no temporary files remain in research directories
- Validate that research indexes exist and are current

**Research Document Quality**
- Verify each document maintains appropriate scope (single research question/topic)
- Flag documents that have grown too large (>3000 words) for potential splitting
- Identify documents that are too sparse (<500 words) for potential consolidation
- Check that research boundaries are clearly defined

**Citation Management**
- Ensure consistent citation formatting across all documents
- Verify source accessibility and link integrity
- Check for duplicate sources across different research files
- Validate research provenance and attribution

### 2. Knowledge Network Audit

**Cross-Reference Integrity**
- Verify all research connections are bidirectional
- Identify orphaned research with no incoming or outgoing connections
- Flag broken links to non-existent documents or sources
- Check for research relationship consistency

**Research Integration Quality**
- Ensure research findings are properly integrated into frameworks
- Verify synthesis documents connect related research streams
- Check that research conclusions are linked to supporting evidence
- Identify potential missing connections based on topic similarity

**Cross-Domain Research Connections**
- Verify adequate connections exist between different research domains
- Check for isolated research clusters that should be connected
- Ensure interdisciplinary research connections are documented

### 3. Research Content Accuracy Audit

**Source Validity**
- Compare research claims against current source materials
- Flag outdated research that no longer reflects current understanding
- Identify missing research for new developments in the field
- Verify research conclusions match evidence presented

**Temporal Accuracy**
- Check that research metadata reflects actual completion dates
- Identify stale research that needs updating or archival
- Flag research marked as "ongoing" that appears complete
- Verify change history entries are complete

**Research Classification**
- Verify all research has complete metadata (domain, methodology, confidence)
- Check that quality ratings match actual evidence strength
- Ensure confidence levels accurately reflect research rigor
- Validate research domain assignments are appropriate

### 4. Research Navigation & Discovery Audit

**Research Entry Points**
- Verify research indexes provide clear orientation
- Check that domain-specific research guides exist and are current
- Ensure research navigation reflects actual investigation paths
- Test common research discovery scenarios

**Research Navigation Paths**
- Verify "Related Research" sections provide valid connections
- Check that research sequences reflect logical progression
- Identify navigation dead-ends in research paths
- Ensure research synthesis paths work correctly

**Research Search & Discovery**
- Check that key terms appear in appropriate research documents
- Verify tag consistency across research archives
- Ensure metadata supports effective research filtering
- Test that common research queries surface relevant results

### 5. Research Quality Standards Audit

**Research Methodology**
- Verify research follows documented methodological standards
- Check for consistent evidence evaluation criteria
- Ensure research validation approaches are documented
- Validate research synthesis procedures are followed

**Evidence Standards**
- Cross-reference evidence quality with stated confidence levels
- Verify source diversity meets project standards
- Check evidence strength against research conclusions
- Ensure bias acknowledgment is appropriate

### 6. Knowledge Evolution & Maintenance Audit

**Research Update Patterns**
- Identify related research that should be updated together
- Check for cascade effects of new findings not propagated
- Verify major discoveries are reflected across relevant research
- Ensure outdated research is properly archived

**Knowledge Growth Patterns**
- Identify areas of rapid research growth needing organization
- Check for emerging research patterns suggesting new domains
- Verify research structure still serves project needs
- Flag areas where research complexity exceeds organization capacity

## Maintenance Process

### Phase 1: Research Discovery & Inventory
1. Read the research index to locate all research components
2. Create inventory of research documents with statistics
3. Map current research archive structure
4. Generate high-level research network visualization

### Phase 2: Systematic Research Review
1. Check each maintenance category systematically
2. Document all findings with specific examples
3. Prioritize issues by impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. Note patterns across multiple research areas

### Phase 3: Research Improvement Recommendations
1. Propose specific fixes for each identified issue
2. Suggest structural improvements based on patterns
3. Recommend process changes to prevent recurring issues
4. Prioritize recommendations by research impact and effort

### Phase 4: Research Validation
1. Cross-check findings against actual research usage
2. Validate proposed changes won't break existing research workflows
3. Ensure recommendations align with research goals
4. Test research navigation paths after proposed changes

## Research Red Flags to Always Check

1. **Research files outside research archives** - Must be properly organized
2. **Framework claims without research support** - Critical knowledge integrity violation
3. **Orphaned research with no framework connections** - Indicates incomplete integration
4. **Circular citation paths** - Can create false validation
5. **Missing bidirectional research connections** - Breaks knowledge network integrity
6. **Stale "current research" markers** - Indicates maintenance failure
7. **Undefined research methodologies** - Reduces research credibility
8. **Inconsistent citation schemes** - Impairs research verification
9. **Missing research change history** - Loses knowledge evolution context
10. **Temporary research files in permanent archives** - Violates organization boundaries
11. **Research findings without supporting citations** - Reduces knowledge credibility
12. **Research indexes with broken file paths** - Breaks research navigation
13. **Framework connections that don't link to discoveries** - Missing research context
14. **Obsolete research not archived** - Causes confusion about current knowledge

## Continuous Improvement

After each maintenance cycle:
1. Update maintenance procedures with new patterns discovered
2. Add new red flags based on issues found
3. Refine reporting format based on research team needs
4. Document research automation opportunities for future tooling
5. Assess research quality standards for potential updates
