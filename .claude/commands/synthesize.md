# synthesize

Transform research findings into actionable frameworks and documented insights

## Usage

When you need to convert research discoveries into structured knowledge, use this command to systematically synthesize findings into frameworks, patterns, and actionable guidance.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Research Compilation

**Objective**: Gather and organize all relevant research materials

1. **Collect Research Sources**
   - Review research archives for relevant reports
   - Identify key citations and their insights  
   - Map connections between different research threads
   - Note conflicting findings or perspectives

2. **Extract Key Insights**
   - Identify recurring patterns across sources
   - Document unique perspectives or outliers
   - Capture practical implications
   - Note gaps in current understanding

3. **Create Synthesis Map**
   - Build conceptual relationships diagram
   - Identify central themes and supporting evidence
   - Map dependencies and contradictions
   - Establish hierarchy of concepts

### Phase 2: Pattern Identification

**Objective**: Discover meaningful patterns and principles

1. **Analyze Themes**
   - Group related insights by theme
   - Identify meta-patterns across themes
   - Distinguish core principles from specifics
   - Document pattern frequency and strength

2. **Validate Patterns**
   - Cross-reference with existing frameworks
   - Check logical consistency
   - Assess practical applicability
   - Identify counter-examples or limitations

3. **Refine Understanding**
   - Clarify pattern boundaries
   - Document contextual factors
   - Specify conditions for applicability
   - Note uncertainties and open questions

### Phase 3: Framework Development

**Objective**: Create structured frameworks from patterns

1. **Design Framework Structure**
   - Define core components and relationships
   - Establish evaluation criteria
   - Create decision trees or flow diagrams
   - Specify input/output expectations

2. **Develop Implementation Guidance**
   - Create practical application steps
   - Provide concrete examples
   - Document edge cases and exceptions
   - Include troubleshooting guidance

3. **Test Framework Logic**
   - Apply to known scenarios
   - Check for internal consistency
   - Validate against research evidence
   - Identify improvement opportunities

### Phase 4: Documentation Integration

**Objective**: Integrate synthesized knowledge into context network

1. **Create Framework Documentation**
   - Write comprehensive framework description
   - Include visual representations
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document theoretical foundation

2. **Update Context Network**
   - Create or update framework nodes
   - Link to supporting research
   - Update navigation indexes
   - Connect to related concepts

3. **Establish Citations**
   - Link all claims to sources
   - Create citation index for framework
   - Document synthesis methodology
   - Note original contributions

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance

**Objective**: Ensure synthesis quality and completeness

1. **Review Logical Consistency**
   - Check for contradictions
   - Validate reasoning chains
   - Assess evidence strength
   - Document confidence levels

2. **Assess Practical Value**
   - Evaluate actionability
   - Check implementation feasibility
   - Consider resource requirements
   - Document expected outcomes

3. **Identify Next Steps**
   - Note areas needing more research
   - Document validation needs
   - Specify refinement opportunities
   - Create follow-up research questions

## Synthesis Patterns

### Convergent Synthesis
Combine multiple sources pointing to same conclusion:
- Strengthen evidence through triangulation
- Build robust theoretical foundation
- Increase confidence in findings

### Divergent Synthesis  
Reconcile conflicting perspectives:
- Identify contextual factors explaining differences
- Create nuanced frameworks acknowledging complexity
- Document conditions for each perspective

### Emergent Synthesis
Discover new insights from combination:
- Identify patterns not visible in individual sources
- Create novel frameworks from synthesis
- Document emergent properties

### Bridge Synthesis
Connect previously unrelated domains:
- Find common principles across fields
- Create interdisciplinary frameworks
- Enable knowledge transfer

## Quality Indicators

**Strong Synthesis:**
- Multiple independent sources support conclusions
- Clear logical progression from evidence to framework
- Practical applicability demonstrated
- Limitations explicitly acknowledged

**Weak Synthesis:**
- Single source dominance
- Logical leaps without support
- Abstract without practical grounding
- Overgeneralization from limited evidence

## Integration Requirements

After synthesis, ensure:
- [ ] All sources properly cited
- [ ] Framework documented in context network
- [ ] Visual representations created where helpful
- [ ] Practical examples provided
- [ ] Limitations and uncertainties documented
- [ ] Navigation paths updated
- [ ] Related concepts linked
- [ ] Future research questions identified

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Cherry-Picking**: Selecting only supporting evidence
2. **Over-Abstraction**: Creating frameworks too general to be useful
3. **False Consensus**: Ignoring legitimate disagreements
4. **Premature Synthesis**: Insufficient research base
5. **Orphan Frameworks**: Not connecting to existing knowledge
