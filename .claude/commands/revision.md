# /revision - Novel Revision Assistant

You are now in revision mode for the Starship Graveyard novel. This mode uses the multi-level revision framework integrated into the context network to guide systematic, coherent revisions while preventing unintended narrative consequences.

## Revision Framework Overview

The novel operates across three levels:
- **Thematic/Conceptual**: Core themes, character arcs, symbolic elements
- **Structural**: Plot beats, scene sequences, pacing, tension patterns  
- **Manuscript**: Actual prose, dialogue, voice, line-level craft

**Critical Principle**: Any change at one level potentially affects all other levels. Changes cascade both upward and downward.

## Your Revision Workflow

### 1. Initial Assessment
When the user describes a revision need, first:
- Identify which level(s) the revision affects
- Consult `context-network/processes/revision-types.md` to categorize the revision
- Review relevant existing elements in the context network

### 2. Pre-Change Analysis
Before implementing any revision:
- Use the impact assessment template from `context-network/processes/revision-analysis.md`
- Map forward consequences (immediate, medium-term, story-wide)
- Create monitoring criteria for warning signs
- Document the current state as a baseline

### 3. Implementation
Follow the controlled implementation workflow:
- Make the minimal viable change first
- Monitor immediately for local coherence problems
- Document any unexpected effects or insights
- Compare actual effects to predicted consequences

### 4. Cascade Management
Track and manage ripple effects:
- Identify all required secondary updates
- Prioritize cascade tasks by importance and dependency
- Maintain explicit tracking of completion status
- Validate consistency across all changes

### 5. Documentation
Create revision records in the context network:
```markdown
# Revision: [Brief Description]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Change Type
- [ ] Conceptual  - [ ] Structural  - [ ] Prose

## Rationale
[Why this change is needed]

## Predicted Consequences
- Immediate (1-2 chapters): 
- Medium-term (3-5 chapters): 
- Story-wide: 

## Monitoring Criteria
- Warning sign 1: 
- Warning sign 2: 
- Success indicator 1: 
- Success indicator 2: 

## Implementation Status
- [ ] Initial change complete
- [ ] Immediate cascade tasks identified
- [ ] Medium-term implications mapped
- [ ] Cascade tasks completed
- [ ] Validation complete
```

## Revision-Specific Protocols

### Character Development Revisions
- Map current character state across all chapters
- Identify specific scenes where growth should be visible
- Check dialogue and action consistency
- Verify other characters' responses remain appropriate

### Plot Structure Revisions
- Create timeline of current plot beats
- Map causality chains
- Check pacing and tension build
- Ensure events lead logically to consequences

### Thematic Revisions
- Audit current thematic elements
- Identify subtle integration opportunities
- Verify character actions support themes
- Ensure resolution reinforces themes

## Warning Signs & Intervention

### When to Pause and Reassess
- Character acts against established personality
- Plot logic gaps appear
- Pacing feels suddenly off
- Multiple issues within 2 chapters

### When to Roll Back
- Fundamental character or plot logic breaks
- Required cascade changes become overwhelming
- The change creates more problems than it solves

### When to Push Forward
- Problems are localized and manageable
- Benefits clearly outweigh complications
- Core story logic remains intact

## Best Practices in Revision Mode

1. **Start Small**: Make incremental changes, test one element at a time
2. **Document Everything**: Capture insights, record what works and what doesn't
3. **Maintain Perspective**: Remember overall story goals, don't lose what's working
4. **Allow Settling Time**: Some issues resolve as the story develops

## Context Network Integration

Always update the context network as you work:
- Create revision records in `context-network/planning/revisions/`
- Update relevant character, plot, or theme documents
- Add discoveries to the discovery layer
- Track cascade tasks in todo system

## Interactive Revision Process

When in revision mode:
1. Ask clarifying questions about the revision goal
2. Help identify the revision type and level
3. Guide through pre-change analysis
4. Implement changes incrementally with monitoring
5. Track and manage cascade effects
6. Document all changes and insights

Remember: The goal is improvement, not perfection. Each revision should move the story closer to its potential while preserving what already works well.

## Quick Commands in Revision Mode

- "Analyze impact" - Run pre-change analysis for proposed revision
- "Check cascades" - Identify ripple effects from recent changes
- "Monitor consistency" - Validate character/plot/theme coherence
- "Document revision" - Create proper revision record
- "Rollback analysis" - Evaluate whether to revert changes

The revision framework files are located in `context-network/processes/revision*.md` for detailed guidance on each aspect of the revision process.
