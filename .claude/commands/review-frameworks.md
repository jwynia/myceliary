# review-frameworks

Systematic review of frameworks for logical consistency, completeness, and practical applicability

## Usage

Use this command to thoroughly review frameworks, analytical models, or structured methodologies to ensure they are logically sound, evidence-based, and practically useful.

## Review Dimensions

### 1. Logical Consistency

**Internal Coherence**
- Do all components work together without contradiction?
- Are definitions used consistently throughout?
- Do conclusions follow from premises?
- Are there circular dependencies?

**Structural Integrity**
- Is the framework's architecture sound?
- Are relationships between components clear?
- Do hierarchies make logical sense?
- Are boundaries well-defined?

**Reasoning Validity**
- Are inference chains valid?
- Are assumptions explicitly stated?
- Are logical fallacies present?
- Is the argumentation complete?

### 2. Evidence Foundation

**Source Quality**
- Are claims backed by credible sources?
- Is evidence current and relevant?
- Are citations accurate and complete?
- Is source diversity adequate?

**Evidence Strength**
- Is evidence sufficient for claims made?
- Are counterexamples addressed?
- Is cherry-picking avoided?
- Are limitations acknowledged?

**Research Gaps**
- What claims lack strong evidence?
- Where is more research needed?
- What assumptions need validation?
- Which patterns need more examples?

### 3. Practical Applicability

**Implementation Clarity**
- Are application steps clear and specific?
- Are prerequisites identified?
- Is guidance actionable?
- Are success criteria defined?

**Contextual Awareness**
- Are use cases well-defined?
- Are limitations explicitly stated?
- Are edge cases addressed?
- Is scope appropriately bounded?

**Value Proposition**
- Does the framework solve real problems?
- Is the benefit worth the complexity?
- Are alternatives considered?
- Is the approach efficient?

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Structural Analysis

1. **Map Framework Components**
   - Identify all major elements
   - Document relationships
   - Note dependencies
   - Check completeness

2. **Test Logical Flow**
   - Trace reasoning paths
   - Verify causal claims
   - Check for contradictions
   - Validate classifications

3. **Assess Complexity**
   - Is complexity justified?
   - Can it be simplified without loss?
   - Are abstractions appropriate?
   - Is cognitive load manageable?

### Phase 2: Evidence Review

1. **Audit Citations**
   ```
   For each major claim:
   - Locate supporting evidence
   - Assess source credibility
   - Check citation accuracy
   - Note evidence strength
   ```

2. **Identify Weak Points**
   - Claims without evidence
   - Single-source dependencies
   - Outdated information
   - Unvalidated assumptions

3. **Check Coverage**
   - Are all perspectives represented?
   - Is contradicting evidence addressed?
   - Are limitations acknowledged?
   - Is uncertainty quantified?

### Phase 3: Practical Assessment

1. **Implementation Testing**
   - Apply framework to known scenarios
   - Test edge cases
   - Evaluate outcome quality
   - Measure effort required

2. **User Perspective**
   - Is terminology accessible?
   - Are concepts clearly explained?
   - Is progression logical?
   - Are examples helpful?

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - How does it compare to alternatives?
   - What unique value does it provide?
   - Where does it excel or fall short?
   - Is it the right tool for the job?

## Common Framework Issues

### Conceptual Problems

**Over-Abstraction**
- Framework too general to be useful
- Lacks concrete guidance
- Cannot be operationalized
- *Solution: Add specific examples and implementation steps*

**Under-Specification**
- Critical details missing
- Ambiguous definitions
- Vague relationships
- *Solution: Define terms precisely, clarify relationships*

**Scope Creep**
- Framework tries to solve everything
- Boundaries unclear
- Complexity overwhelming
- *Solution: Narrow focus, define explicit boundaries*

### Logical Problems

**False Dichotomies**
- Presents only two options when more exist
- *Solution: Acknowledge spectrum of possibilities*

**Correlation/Causation Confusion**
- Assumes causal relationships without evidence
- *Solution: Clarify relationship types, provide evidence*

**Circular Reasoning**
- Definitions refer back to themselves
- *Solution: Ground definitions in external concepts*

### Practical Problems

**Ivory Tower Syndrome**
- Theoretically sound but practically unusable
- *Solution: Add real-world examples and constraints*

**Missing Prerequisites**
- Assumes knowledge or resources not available
- *Solution: Document all requirements explicitly*

**Success Theater**
- Only shows ideal scenarios
- *Solution: Include failure modes and recovery paths*
