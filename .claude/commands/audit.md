# audit

Comprehensive research quality and knowledge integrity assessment

## Usage

Use this command to systematically evaluate the quality, accuracy, and completeness of research materials, frameworks, and documentation within the context network.

## Audit Scope

The audit examines:
- Research quality and credibility
- Citation accuracy and completeness  
- Logical consistency across documents
- Knowledge organization effectiveness
- Framework validity and applicability
- Documentation clarity and accessibility

## Audit Process

### Phase 1: Research Quality Assessment

**Source Credibility Analysis:**
- Primary vs secondary sources
- Author expertise and bias
- Publication quality and peer review
- Recency and relevance
- Geographic and cultural perspectives
- Conflicting viewpoints representation

**Evidence Strength Evaluation:**
- Claims to evidence mapping
- Statistical significance where applicable
- Reproducibility of findings
- Sample size and methodology rigor
- Generalizability limitations
- Counter-evidence consideration

### Phase 2: Citation Integrity Review

**Citation Completeness:**
- All claims properly attributed
- Source documents accessible
- Citation format consistency
- Link rot and broken references
- Version/edition accuracy
- Page numbers and specificity

**Citation Network Analysis:**
- Over-reliance on single sources
- Citation diversity and breadth
- Circular citation patterns
- Missing foundational works
- Recent developments included
- Cross-disciplinary connections

### Phase 3: Logical Consistency Analysis

**Internal Consistency:**
- Contradictions between documents
- Definition consistency across network
- Framework alignment
- Assumption compatibility
- Conclusion validity

**Structural Coherence:**
- Navigation path logic
- Concept hierarchy validity
- Relationship accuracy
- Categorization consistency
- Boundary clarity

### Phase 4: Knowledge Organization Review

**Information Architecture:**
- Document size optimization (100-300 lines)
- Atomic note principles
- Navigation hub effectiveness
- Search discoverability
- Link density and quality

**Content Accessibility:**
- Progressive disclosure implementation
- Glossary completeness
- Visual aid usage
- Example quality and relevance
- Entry point clarity

### Phase 5: Framework Validation

**Theoretical Soundness:**
- Logical argument structure
- Assumption explicitness
- Scope appropriateness
- Abstraction level balance
- Predictive capability

**Practical Applicability:**
- Implementation guidance clarity
- Real-world examples
- Success criteria definition
- Limitation acknowledgment
- Resource requirement specification
