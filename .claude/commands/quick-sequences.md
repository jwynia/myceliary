### Evening Research Synthesis (10 min)
```bash
/checklist
/discovery
/sync --last 1d
```
*End your day capturing research knowledge and updating reality.*

## 📅 Weekly Research Sequences

### Monday Research Planning (30 min)
```bash
/sync --last 1w
/status --detailed --metrics
/retrospective
/groom --stale 7
/groom --generate-sprint
```
*Start your week with clean research slate and clear plan.*

### Friday Research Quality Review (45 min)
```bash
/audit --scope research
/review-frameworks
/maintenance
/status --research --risks
```
*End your week with research quality checked and risks identified.*

## 🏃 Research Sprint Sequences

### Research Sprint Start (60 min)
```bash
/sync --all
/groom --all
/plan research-sprint-goals
/status --detailed
```
*Begin research sprint with everything aligned and ready.*

### Research Sprint End (90 min)
```bash
/sync --research
/retrospective

## 🔥 Special Research Situations

### After Research Methodology Issue
```bash
/sync --all
/status --risks
/audit --methodology --sources
/retrospective
/plan "research-quality-measures"
```
*Learn from research issues and prevent recurrence.*

### Before Knowledge Publication
```bash
/sync --all
/audit --all --strict
/review-frameworks --all
/status --detailed --risks
/checklist
```
*Ensure everything is ready for publication.*

### New Researcher Onboarding

## 🎯 One-Liner Research Sequences

**"What research should I work on?"**
```bash
/groom --ready-only
```

**"What's the research status?"**
```bash
/status --brief --research
```

**"Is my research quality okay?"**
```bash
/audit --scope research
```

**"What did we learn from research?"**
```bash
/retrospective
```

**"Is everything researched and documented?"**
```bash
/sync --dry-run
```

**"What research issues exist?"**
```bash
/status --risks
```

**"Clean up research archives"**
```bash
/maintenance
```

## 💡 Research Pro Tips

1. **Chain related research commands**: Output from one informs the next research step
2. **Use --dry-run first**: Preview before applying research changes
3. **Start with --brief**: Get research overview before diving deep
4. **End with /checklist**: Never lose important research work
5. **Document immediately**: /discovery while research memory is fresh

## 🔄 Research Command Combinations

### The Research Reality Check
```bash
/sync --dry-run && /status --brief --research
```
*What research is planned vs what's real?*

### The Research Quality Sweep
```bash
/audit --scope research && /review-frameworks
```
*How good is recent research work?*

### The Research Planning Combo
```bash
/groom --all && /plan next-research-sprint
```
*Get ready for what's next in research.*

### The Knowledge Capture
```bash
/discovery && /retrospective
```
*Document research learnings and insights.*

### The Research Risk Scanner
```bash
/status --risks && /audit --methodology
```
*What could go wrong with research?*

## 📈 Research Automation Priority

Start automating research sequences in this order:
1. Daily Morning Research Review (highest value, lowest effort)
2. Pre-synthesis Checks (catch issues early)
3. Weekly Monday Research Planning (maintain momentum)
4. Research Sprint End Sequence (ensure closure)
5. Monthly Research Health Check (proactive maintenance)

Remember: **Consistency beats intensity**. Better to run simple research sequences daily than complex ones rarely.
