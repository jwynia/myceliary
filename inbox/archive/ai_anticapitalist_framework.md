# Framework for Identifying Anti-Capitalist AI Applications

## Core Premise

This framework helps identify AI and LLM applications that either operate outside capitalist incentive structures or actively undermine them. Rather than cataloging specific use cases, it provides inquiry methods to discover opportunities where AI could serve human needs that profit-driven systems ignore, exploit, or actively harm.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Market Failure Spaces
Areas where profit motives create perverse incentives or where no profitable market exists:
- Public goods and commons management
- Care work and emotional labor
- Community resilience and mutual aid
- Environmental stewardship
- Knowledge preservation and sharing

### Counter-Hegemonic Applications
Tools that actively challenge or subvert extractive systems:
- Alternative economic coordination (time banks, gift economies)
- Collective organizing and solidarity networks
- Resource redistribution mechanisms
- Corporate accountability and transparency tools

### Democratization Vectors
AI that redistributes rather than concentrates power:
- Decentralized decision-making processes
- Skill and knowledge commons
- Community self-governance tools
- Direct democracy facilitation

### Temporal Dynamics
How applications evolve through time and crisis:
- Crisis response and community resilience during system failures
- Evolution and degradation patterns of resistance tools
- Lifecycle management before co-optation or neutralization
- Emergent need identification before market capture

### Scale and Interconnection
Network effects and federation considerations:
- Cross-community knowledge sharing vs. local adaptation
- Critical mass implications and power structure threats
- Tool interconnection and mutual reinforcement
- Federation vs. isolation trade-offs

### Epistemological Dimensions
Knowledge systems and ways of knowing:
- Indigenous and traditional knowledge integration
- Non-Western and non-academic epistemologies
- Community wisdom vs. techno-solutionist approaches
- Embodied and experiential knowledge preservation

### Ecological Integration
Relationship to material world and environmental justice:
- Resource footprint and ecological limits
- Appropriate technology and dependency considerations
- Environmental justice integration
- Bioregional and place-based applications

### Conflict and Repression Resistance
Operating under hostile conditions:
- State and corporate repression resilience
- Security culture and vulnerable community protection
- Sabotage and infiltration resistance
- Underground and parallel infrastructure development

## Inquiry Methodology

### Primary Questions

**1. Structural Analysis**
- What human needs are currently unmet because they're unprofitable to address?
- Where do profit motives actively harm community wellbeing?
- What work is essential but economically invisible or undervalued?

**2. Power Dynamics**

- What information asymmetries could be eliminated to benefit communities?
- Where are people currently dependent on extractive systems for basic needs?

**3. Resistance Potential**
- What makes an AI application structurally difficult to commodify?
- How can tools be designed to remain community-controlled?
- What features would make corporate co-optation unlikely or impossible?

**4. Temporal and Crisis Analysis**
- How do community needs change during crisis moments or system failures?
- What tools become essential when capitalist infrastructure breaks down?
- How can AI applications evolve with communities rather than becoming obsolete?
- What's the typical lifecycle of resistance tools before neutralization?

**5. Knowledge Systems Integration**
- What local, indigenous, or non-academic knowledge systems need technological support?
- How can AI complement rather than replace community wisdom and embodied knowledge?
- What epistemological assumptions are embedded in proposed technological solutions?
- How do we avoid techno-colonial approaches that dismiss existing practices?

**6. Ecological and Material Considerations**
- What are the environmental costs and benefits of this AI application?
- How does this tool relate to bioregional needs and ecological limits?
- What level of technological dependency is appropriate for community resilience?
- How does this application support or undermine environmental justice?

**7. Security and Repression Resilience**
- How vulnerable is this application to state or corporate interference?
- What security measures protect users without creating barriers to access?
- How can the tool function under conditions of active repression or surveillance?
- What backup systems exist if primary infrastructure is compromised?

### Secondary Questions

**Community Needs Assessment**
- What collective challenges do communities face that require coordination?
- Where is care work overwhelming individuals or being neglected?
- What knowledge or skills are siloed when they could benefit everyone?

**System Vulnerabilities**
- Where are capitalist systems brittle or dependent on information control?
- What alternative economic models need better coordination tools?
- How could transparency tools expose harmful corporate practices?

**Scaling and Sustainability**
- How can AI applications grow without requiring venture capital?
- What governance models prevent mission drift toward profit maximization?
- How can communities maintain technical sovereignty over their tools?
- What federation models allow tool interconnection while preserving local control?
- How do tools evolve with communities rather than becoming obsolete or co-opted?

**Network Effects and Interconnection**
- How do multiple anti-capitalist AI tools reinforce each other's effectiveness?
- What happens when these applications reach critical mass or threaten existing power?
- How can cross-community knowledge sharing occur without homogenization?
- What are the trade-offs between local adaptation and broader coordination?

**Crisis and Resilience Planning**
- How do these tools function during economic, political, or environmental crises?
- What backup systems exist when primary infrastructure fails or is compromised?
- How can applications be designed for use under conditions of active repression?
- What security measures protect vulnerable users without creating barriers to access?

## Application Process

1. **Identify the Gap** - What human need is currently unmet or poorly served?
2. **Analyze the Failure** - Why isn't capitalism addressing this need adequately?
3. **Map Power Relations** - Who benefits from the current situation and who suffers?
4. **Explore AI Potential** - How could AI/LLM capabilities address the underlying issue?
5. **Design for Anti-Capture** - What features would prevent commodification?
6. **Test Community Fit** - Does this actually serve identified community needs and knowledge systems?
7. **Plan for Sustainability** - How can this exist and grow outside capitalist frameworks?
8. **Assess Ecological Impact** - What are the environmental costs and appropriate technology considerations?
9. **Security and Resilience Planning** - How does this function under crisis or repression conditions?
10. **Network Integration** - How does this connect with other anti-capitalist tools and communities?

## Further Development
