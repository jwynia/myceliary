# [PROJECT NAME TBD] - Anti-Capitalist AI Framework Project

## Project Overview

This project develops and shares frameworks for identifying, evaluating, and building AI and LLM applications that serve human needs outside of or in opposition to capitalist structures. Rather than cataloging specific use cases, we focus on inquiry methodologies, evaluation frameworks, and collaborative tools that help communities and technologists discover opportunities where AI could genuinely serve liberation rather than extraction.

## Core Problem

Most AI development follows profit-driven patterns, creating tools that optimize exploitation, extract data for corporate benefit, or provide technological solutions to problems created by capitalism itself. Meanwhile, genuine human needs that capitalism systematically ignores or actively harms remain unaddressed by AI innovation. Communities need frameworks to identify these gaps, evaluate proposed solutions for hidden traps, and build genuinely community-controlled alternatives.

## What We're Building

### Primary Frameworks

**Framework for Identifying Anti-Capitalist AI Applications**
- Systematic inquiry methodology for discovering AI applications that operate outside capitalist incentives
- Analysis tools for market failure spaces, counter-hegemonic potential, and democratization opportunities
- Integration of temporal, ecological, epistemological, and security considerations
- Community-centered evaluation criteria and implementation guidance

**Capitalist Trap Detection and Solution Strengthening Framework**
- Methods for identifying when AI solutions that appear helpful actually serve capitalist interests
- Analysis tools for common trap patterns: efficiency, individualization, platform dependency, data extraction, innovation theater, and algorithmic gatekeeping
- Systematic process for strengthening community-controlled alternatives
- Evaluation checklists and red flag identification systems

**Research Query Framework**
- Structured approach to ongoing research and monitoring
- Query categories from basic web search to deep research reports
- Temporal organization for one-time foundational research and ongoing monitoring
- Crisis-responsive and geographically diverse research strategies

### Project Components

## Scope and Boundaries

### What This Project Includes

**Framework Development:**
- Systematic inquiry methodologies for identifying anti-capitalist AI opportunities
- Evaluation tools for assessing solutions and strengthening alternatives
- Research strategies for ongoing monitoring and learning
- Community governance approaches for maintaining project integrity

**Community Collaboration:**
- Tools and processes for distributed contribution and feedback
- Documentation of real-world testing and implementation
- Connection facilitation between communities working on similar challenges
- Resource sharing and collective learning infrastructure

**Knowledge Commons Building:**
- Open source frameworks available for adaptation and local implementation
- Research compilation accessible to communities without academic access
- Educational materials for community technology literacy
- Case study documentation for collective learning

### What This Project Excludes

**Specific Technology Development:**
- We provide frameworks for evaluation and discovery, not implementation of specific AI tools
- Technical development happens in community contexts using these frameworks
- We support rather than substitute for community-led technology work

**Prescriptive Solutions:**
- We avoid one-size-fits-all recommendations that ignore local context and community self-determination
- Frameworks are designed for adaptation rather than rigid application
- Community wisdom and local knowledge take precedence over technological solutions

**Corporate Engagement:**
- We do not partner with or accept funding from entities whose interests conflict with community self-determination
- We avoid legitimizing corporate "social responsibility" initiatives through participation
- We maintain independence from institutional pressures that could compromise anti-capitalist analysis

## Development Approach

### Community-Centered Development
- Framework development guided by feedback from communities actually using these tools
- Regular testing and iteration based on real-world application experiences
- Governance structures that maintain community accountability rather than academic or technical expert control
- Integration with existing community technology and organizing networks

### Collaborative Research Model
- Distributed research conducted by contributors with diverse perspectives and expertise
- Research priorities set by community needs rather than academic publication pressures
- Open documentation of research process and findings
- Integration of multiple knowledge systems and epistemological approaches

### Anti-Capitalist Infrastructure
- Project sustainability through grants and donations that don't compromise independence
- Governance structures that prevent mission drift or co-optation
- Technology choices that maintain community control and avoid corporate dependency
- Resource sharing with other community technology and organizing projects

## Initial Development Phases

### Phase 1: Framework Refinement and Testing (Months 1-6)
- Community feedback collection on existing framework drafts
- Testing with real community technology projects and organizing contexts
- Research infrastructure development and initial source compilation
- Basic website and repository establishment

### Phase 2: Community Engagement and Tool Development (Months 6-12)
- Workshop development and community education material creation
- Interactive web tools for framework application
- Case study documentation and analysis
- Expanded research program and source compilation

### Phase 3: Network Building and Federation (Months 12-18)
- Integration with existing community technology networks
- Cross-project collaboration and resource sharing
- Advanced community governance development
- Long-term sustainability and governance structure establishment

### Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance and Evolution (18+ Months)
- Regular framework updates based on changing technological and political contexts
- Continued community education and capacity building
- Research program expansion and deepening
- Long-term project evolution based on community needs and feedback

- Strengthened community self-determination and reduced dependency on extractive systems
- Integration with broader anti-capitalist organizing and movement building

## Long-Term Vision

This project aims to contribute to a broader ecosystem of community-controlled technology development that serves liberation rather than extraction. We envision communities equipped with analysis tools that help them navigate technological choices with clear anti-capitalist frameworks, resist corporate co-optation of their initiatives, and build genuinely community-controlled alternatives that strengthen collective power and mutual aid.

The frameworks developed here should become tools that communities adapt and improve based on their own needs and contexts, contributing to a knowledge commons that strengthens community technology work across diverse struggles and geographies. Success means these frameworks become unnecessary because communities have internalized the analysis and developed their own locally appropriate tools for community-controlled technology development.
