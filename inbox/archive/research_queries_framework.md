- Monitor both successes and failures
- Document changing political and economic contexts
- Note seasonal patterns in organizing and development

**Quality Assessment:**
- Prioritize sources that center affected communities
- Seek diverse perspectives within anti-capitalist frameworks
- Verify claims through multiple sources
- Document conflicts and contradictions in findings
